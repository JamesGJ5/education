# When storing elements of a queue in an array of size n, you can only store up to n-1 elements in this array, for
# reasons mentioned at 11:40 onwards. If you want to add more queue elements, need to make a bigger array.

# With the array above, enqueueing (adding element to back of queue) and dequeueing (removing element from front of
# queue) take O(1) time.

# In a deque, you can add and remove data from both ends of a queue. Could have functions called addLeft, removeLeft,
# addRight, removeRight.

# algoexpert.io/csdojo, with referral code csdojo, can be used to practise stacks and queues.
