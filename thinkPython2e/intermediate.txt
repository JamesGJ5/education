preface



the
circumstances
which
have
led
to
the
publication
of
this
volume
are

briefly

these


during
one
of
the
editorâ€™s
official
visits
to
balmoral

her
majesty
very
kindly
allowed
him
to
see
several
extracts
from
her
journal

relating
to
excursions
in
the
highlands
of
scotland

he
was
much
interested
by
them

and
expressed
the
interest
which
he
felt

it
then
occurred
to
her
majesty
that
these
extracts

referring

as
they
did

to
some
of
the
happiest
hours
of
her
life

might
be
made
into
a
book

to
be
printed
privately

for
presentation
to
members
of
the
royal
family
and
her
majestyâ€™s
intimate
friends

especially
to
those
who
had
accompanied
and
attended
her
in
these
tours


it
was
then
suggested
to
her
majesty
by
some
persons

among
them
a
near
and
dear
relative
of
the
queen

and
afterwards
by
the
editor

that
this
work

if
made
known
to
others

would
be
very
interesting
to
them
as
well
as
to
the
royal
family
and
to
her
majestyâ€™s
intimate
friends

the
queen

however

said

that
she
had
no
skill
whatever
in
authorship

that
these
were

for
the
most
part

mere
homely
accounts
of
excursions
near
home

and
that
she
felt
extremely
reluctant
to
publish
anything
written
by
herself


to
this
the
editor
respectfully
replied

that

if
printed
at
all

however
limited
the
impression

and
however
careful
the
selection
of
persons
to
whom
copies
might
be
given

some
portions
of
the
volume

or
quite
as
probably
incorrect
representations
of
its
contents

might
find
their
way
into
the
public
journals

it
would
therefore

he
thought

be
better
at
once
to
place
the
volume
within
the
reach
of
her
majestyâ€™s
subjects

who
would

no
doubt

derive
from
it
pleasure
similar
to
that
which
it
had
afforded
to
the
editor
himself

moreover

it
would
be
very
gratifying
to
her
subjects

who
had
always
shown
a
sincere
and
ready
sympathy
with
the
personal
joys
and
sorrows
of
their
sovereign


to
be
allowed
to
know
how
her
rare
moments
of
leisure
were
passed
in
her
highland
home

when
every
joy
was
heightened

and
every
care
and
sorrow
diminished

by
the
loving
companionship
of
the
prince
consort

with
his
memory
the
scenes
to
which
this
volume
refers
would
always
be
associated


upon
these
considerations
her
majesty
eventually
consented
to
its
publication


while
the
book
was
being
printed

the
editor
suggested
that
it
would
gain
in
interest
if
other
extracts
were
added
to
it

describing
her
majestyâ€™s
progresses
in
england

ireland

and
the
channel
islands


the
queen
was
pleased
to
assent

and
the
additions
were
accordingly
made












































it
will
easily
be
seen
that
this
little
work
does
not
make
any
pretension
to
be
more
than
such
a
record
of
the
impressions
received
by
the
royal
author
in
the
course
of
these
journeys

as
might
hereafter
serve
to
recall
to
her
own
mind
the
scenes
and
circumstances
which
had
been
the
source
of
so
much
pleasure

all
references
to
political
questions

or
to
the
affairs
of
government

have

for
obvious
reasons

been
studiously
omitted

the
book
is
mainly
confined
to
the
natural
expressions
of
a
mind
rejoicing
in
the
beauties
of
nature

and
throwing
itself

with
a
delight
rendered
keener
by
the
rarity
of
its
opportunities

into
the
enjoyment
of
a
life
removed

for
the
moment

from
the
pressure
of
public
cares












































it
would
not
be
becoming
in
the
editor
to
dwell
largely
upon
the
merits
of
this
work

he
may

however

allude
to
the
picturesque
descriptions
of
scenery
in
which
the
work
abounds

to
the
simplicity
of
diction
throughout
it

and
to
the
perfect
faithfulness
of
narration
which
is
one
of
its
chief
characteristics

for
in
every
page
the
writer
describes
what
she
thinks
and
feels

rather
than
what
she
might
be
expected
to
think
and
feel


moreover

he
may
point
out
the
willingness
to
be
pleased

upon
which
so
much
of
the
enjoyment
of
any
tour
depends

and
also
the
exceeding
kindliness
of
feeling

the
gratitude
even

with
which
the
royal
tourists
recognize
any
attention
paid
to
them

or
any
manifestation
of
the
cordial
attachment
felt
towards
them

by
any
of
her
majestyâ€™s
subjects

from
the
highest
to
the
humblest

whom
they
happen
to
meet
with
in
the
course
of
their
journeys












































the
editor
thinks
that
he
should
not
be
doing
justice
to
the
royal
authorâ€™s
book

not
doing
what

if
it
were
any
other
personâ€™s
work
which
was
entrusted
to
his
editing

he
should
do

if
he
were
to
forbear
giving
utterance
to
the
thoughts
which
occurred
to
him
in
reference
to
the
notes
to
the
volume


these
notes

besides
indicating
that
peculiar
memory
for
persons

and
that
recognition
of
personal
attachment

which
have
been
very
noticeable
in
our
sovereigns

illustrate

in
a
striking
manner

the
patriarchal
feeling

if
one
may
apply
such
a
word
as
â€œpatriarchalâ€
to
a
lady

which
is
so
strong
in
the
present
occupant
of
the
throne

perhaps
there
is
no
person
in
these
realms
who
takes
a
more
deep
and
abiding
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
household
committed
to
his
charge
than
our
gracious
queen
does
in
hers

or
who
feels
more
keenly
what
are
the
reciprocal
duties
of
masters
and
servants


nor
does
any
one
wish
more
ardently
than
her
majesty

that
there
should
be
no
abrupt
severance
of
class
from
class

but
rather
a
gradual
blending
together
of
all
classes


caused
by
a
full
community
of
interests

a
constant
interchange
of
good
offices

and
a
kindly
respect
felt
and
expressed
by
each
class
to
all
its
brethren
in
the
great
brotherhood
that
forms
a
nation


those
whose
duty
it
has
been
to
attend
upon
the
queen
in
matters
of
business

must
have
noticed
that
her
majesty

as
a
person
well
versed
in
the
conduct
of
affairs

is
wont
to
keep
closely
to
the
point
at
issue

and
to
speak
of
nothing
but
what
is
directly
connected
with
the
matter
before
her

but
whenever
there
is
an
exception
to
this
rule

it
arises
from
her
majestyâ€™s
anxious
desire
to
make
some
inquiry
about
the
welfare
of
her
subjects

to
express
her
sympathy
with
this
manâ€™s
sorrow

or
on
that
manâ€™s
bereavement

to
ask
what
is
the
latest
intelligence
about
this
disaster

or
that
suffering

and
what
can
be
done
to
remedy
or
assuage
it

thus
showing

unconsciously

that
she
is

indeed

the
mother
of
her
people

taking
the
deepest
interest
in
all
that
concerns
them

without
respect
of
persons

from
the
highest
to
the
lowest












































the
editor
thinks
that
one
point
of
interest
which
will
incidentally
be
disclosed
by
this
publication

is
the
aspect
of
the
court
in
these
our
times

what
would
not
the
historian
give
to
have
similar
materials
within
his
reach

when
writing
about
the
reigns
of
the
great
queen
elizabeth
or
the
good
queen
anne

there
is
always
something
in
the
present
which
has
the
appearance
of
being
trivial
and
prosaic

but
the
future
historian
will
delight
in
having
details
before
him
furnished
by
this
book
and
by
the

life
of
the
prince
consort

1


which
will
enable
him
fully
to
describe
the
reign
of
victoria

and
justly
to
appreciate
the
private
life
of
a
sovereign
whose
public
life
will
enter
so
largely
into
the
annals
of
the
nineteenth
century



1

a
work
which
has
met
with
a
very
cordial
reception
from
the
public

and
which

from
what
the
editor
has
seen

will
not
by
any
means
diminish
in
interest
as
it
proceeds
to
describe
the
full
and
busy
life
of
the
prince
as
a
man


one
more
remark
the
editor
cannot
refrain
from
making

namely

that
it
is
evident
that
her
majesty
never
takes
for
granted
the
services
and
attentions
which
are
rendered
to
her

and
which
we
all
know
would
be
rendered
to
her
from
dutiful
respect
and
regard

but
views
them
as
especial
kindnesses
shown
to
herself

and
to
which
she
makes
no
claim
whatever
from
her
exalted
position
as
a
sovereign


this
latter
trait

very
characteristic
of
the
royal
author

gives

throughout

an
additional
charm
to
the
book

which

on
that
account
alone

and
apart
even
from
its
many
other
merits

will

the
editor
doubts
not

be
gratefully
and
affectionately

been
following

covered
with
people






tuesday

august
30



we
heard

to
our
great
distress

that
we
had
only
gone
58
miles
since
eight
oâ€™clock
last
night

how
annoying
and
provoking
this
is

we
remained
on
deck
all
day
lying
on
sofas

the
sea
was
very
rough
towards
evening

and
i
was
very
ill

we
reached

flamborough
head

on
the
yorkshire
coast
by
half
past
five






wednesday

august
31



at
five
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
we
heard

to
our
great
vexation

that
we
had
only
been
going
three
knots
an
hour
in
the
night

and
were
50
miles
from

st

abbâ€™s
head



we
passed

coquet
island

and

bamborough
castle

on
the
northumberland
coast

which
i
was
unfortunately
unable
to
see

but
from
my
cabin
i
saw

ferne
island


with
grace
darlingâ€™s
lighthouse
on
it

also

rocky
islands

and

holy
island


at
half
past
five
i
went
on
deck

and
immediately
lay
down

we
then
came
in
sight
of
the
scotch
coast

which
is
very
beautiful

so
dark

rocky

bold

and
wild

totally
unlike
our
coast

we
passed

st

abbâ€™s
head

at
half
past
six

numbers
of
fishing
boats

in
one
of
which
was
a
piper
playing

and
steamers
full
of
people
came
out
to
meet
us

and
on
board
of
one
large
steamer
they
danced
a
reel
to
a
band

it
was
a
beautiful
evening

calm

with
a
fine
sunset

and
the
air
so
pure


one
cannot
help
noticing
how
much
longer
the
days
are
here
than
they
were
in

england


it
was
not
really
dark
till
past
eight
oâ€™clock

and
on
monday
and
tuesday
evening
at

windsor

it
was
nearly
dark
by
half
past
seven

quite
so
before
eight

the
men
begged
leave
to
dance

which
they
did
to
the
sound
of
a
violin
played
by
a
little
sailor
boy

they
also
sang


we
remained
on
deck
till
twenty
five
minutes
to
nine

and
saw
many
bonfires
on
the
scotch
coast

at

dunbar


lord
haddingtonâ€™s
place


tyninghame


and
at
other
points
on
the
coast

we
let
off
four
rockets

and
burned
two
blue
lights

it
is
surprising
to
see
the
sailors
climb
on
the
bowsprit
and
up
to
the
top
of
the
mast
head

this
too
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
night

the
man
who
carried
the
lantern
to
the
main
top
ran
up
with
it
in
his
mouth
to
the
top

they
are
so
handy
and
so
well
conducted


we
felt
most
thankful
and
happy
that
we
were
near
our
journeyâ€™s
end






thursday

september
1



at
a
quarter
to
one
oâ€™clock

we
heard
the
anchor
let
down

a
welcome
sound

at
seven
we
went
on
deck

where
we
breakfasted

close
on
one
side
were

leith

and
the
high
hills
towering
over

edinburgh


which
was
in
fog

and
on
the
other
side
was
to
be
seen
the

isle
of
may


where
it
is
said
macduff
held
out
against
macbeth


the

bass
rock

being
behind
us

at
ten
minutes
past
eight
we
arrived
at

granton
pier


where
we
were
met
by
the
duke
of
buccleuch

sir
robert
peel
and
others

they
came
on
board
to
see
us

and
sir
robert
told
us
that
the
people
were
all
in
the
highest
good
humour

though
naturally
a
little
disappointed
at
having
waited
for
us
yesterday

we
then
stepped
over
a
gangway
on
to
the
pier

the
people
cheering

and
the
duke
saying
that
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
welcome
us

our
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
landed
before
us

safe
and
well

and
we
two
got
into
a
barouche

the
ladies
and
gentlemen
following

the
duke

the
equerries

and
mr

anson
rode


there
were

however

not
nearly
so
many
people
in

edinburgh


though
the
crowd
and
crush
were
such
that
one
was
really
continually
in
fear
of
accidents

more
regularity
and
order
would
have
been
preserved
had
there
not
been
some
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
provost
about
giving
due
notice
of
our
approach

the
impression

edinburgh

has
made
upon
us
is
very
great

it
is
quite
beautiful

totally
unlike
anything
else
i
have
seen

and
what
is
even
more

albert

who
has
seen
so
much

says
it
is
unlike
anything

he

ever
saw

it
is
so
regular

everything
built
of
massive
stone

there
is
not
a
brick
to
be
seen
anywhere

the

high
street


which
is
pretty
steep

is
very
fine

then
the
castle

situated
on
that
grand
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
town

is
most
striking

on
the
other
side
the

calton
hill


with
the

national
monument


a
building
in
the
grecian
style


nelsonâ€™s
monument



burnsâ€™
monument


the

gaol


the

national
school



c


all
magnificent
buildings

and
with

arthurâ€™s
seat

in
the
background

over
topping
the
whole

form
altogether
a
splendid
spectacle

the
enthusiasm
was
very
great

and
the
people
very
friendly
and
kind

the
royal
archers
body
guard
2

met
us
and
walked
with
us
the
whole
way
through
the
town

it
is
composed
entirely
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen

and
they
all
walked
close
by
the
carriage

but
were
dreadfully
pushed
about

amongst
them
were
the
duke
of
roxburgh
and
lord
elcho
on
my
side

and
sir
j

hope
on
albertâ€™s
side

lord
elcho
3


whom
i
did
not
know
at
the
time

pointed
out
the
various
monuments
and
places
to
me
as
we
came
along

when
we
were
out
of
the
town

we
went
faster

every
cottage
is
built
of
stone

and
so
are
all
the
walls
that
are
used
as
fences



2

the
duke
of
buccleuch
told
me
the
other
day

that
the
archers
guard
was
established
by
james
i


and
was
composed
of
men
who
were
mounted
and
armed
from
head
to
foot

and
who
were
bound
always
to
be
near
the
sovereignâ€™s
person

at
flodden
field

king
james
iv
â€™s
body

it
is
said

was
found
covered
and
surrounded
by
the
bodies
of
the
archers
guard



3

now
earl
of
wemyss


the
country
and
people
have
quite
a
different
character
from

england

and
the
english

the
old
women
wear
close
caps

and
all
the
children
and
girls
are
bare
footed

i
saw
several
handsome
girls
and
children
with
long
hair

indeed
all
the
poor
girls
from
sixteen
and
seventeen
down
to
two
or
three
years
old

have
loose
flowing
hair

a
great
deal
of
it
red


as
we
came
along
we
saw

craigmillar
castle


a
ruin

where
mary

queen
of
scots

used
to
live

we
reached

dalkeith

at
eleven

a
large
house

constructed
of
reddish
stone

the
greater
part
built
by
the
duchess
of
monmouth

and
the
park
is
very
fine
and
large

the
house
has
three
fronts

with
the
entrance
on
the
left
as
you
drive
up

the

duchess
of
buccleuch
arrived
directly
after
us

and
we
were
shown
up
a
very
handsome
staircase
to
our
rooms

which
are
very
comfortable

we
both
felt
dreadfully
tired
and
giddy


we
drove
out
together

the
park
is
very
extensive

with
a
beautiful
view
of

arthurâ€™s
seat

and
the

pentland
hills


and
there
is
a
pretty
drive
overhanging
a
deep
valley

at
eight
we
dined

a
large
party

everybody
was
very
kind
and
civil

and
full
of
inquiries
as
to
our
voyage






dalkeith
house

friday

september
2



at
breakfast
i
tasted
the
oatmeal
porridge

which
i
think
very
good

and
also
some
of
the
â€œfinnan
haddies
â€
we
then
walked
out

the
pleasure
grounds
seem
very
extensive
and
beautiful

wild
and
hilly

we
walked
down
along
the
stream

the
river

esk



up
a
steep
bank
to
a
little
cottage

and
came
home
by
the
upper
part
of
the
walk

at
four
oâ€™clock
we
drove
out
with
the
duchess
of
buccleuch
and
the
duchess
of
norfolk

the
duke
and
equerries
riding

the
others
in
another
carriage

we
drove
through

dalkeith


which
was
full
of
people

all
running
and
cheering


albert
says
that
many
of
the
people
look
like
germans

the
old
women
with
that
kind
of
cap
which
they
call
a
â€œmutch
â€
and
the
young
girls
and
children
with
flowing
hair

and
many
of
them
pretty

are
very
picturesque

you
hardly
see
any
women
with
bonnets


such
a
thick
â€œscotch
mistâ€
came
on
that
we
were
obliged
to
drive
home
through
the
village
of

lasswade


and
through
lord
melvilleâ€™s
park

which
is
very
fine






saturday

september
3



at
ten
oâ€™clock
we
set
off

we
two
in
the
barouche

all
the
others
following

for

edinburgh


we
drove
in
under

arthurâ€™s
seat


where
the
crowd
began
to
be
very
great

and
here
the
guard
of
royal
archers
met
us

lord
elcho
walking
near
me

and
the
duke
of
roxburgh
and
sir
j

hope
on
albertâ€™s
side

we
passed
by

holyrood
chapel


which
is
very
old
and
full
of
interest

and

holyrood
palace


a
royal
looking
old
place

the
procession
moved
through
the

old
town

up
the

high
street


which
is
a
most
extraordinary
street
from
the
immense
height
of
the
houses

most
of
them
being
eleven
stories
high

and
different
families
living
in
each
story

every
window
was
crammed
full
of
people

they
showed
us

knoxâ€™s
house


a
curious
old
building

as
is
also
the

regent
murrayâ€™s
house


which
is
in
perfect
preservation

in
the

old
town

the

high
church


and

st

paulâ€™s

in
the

new
town


are
very
fine
buildings

at
the
barrier

the
provost
presented
us
with
the
keys


the
girls
of
the

orphan
asylum


and
the
trades
in
old
costumes

were
on
a
platform

further
on
was
the

new
church


to
which

strange
to
say

as
the
church
is
nearly
finished

they
were
going
to
lay
the
foundation
stone

we
at
length
reached
the
castle

to
the
top
of
which
we
walked


the
view
from
both
batteries
is
splendid

like
a
panorama
in
extent

we
saw
from
them

heriotâ€™s
hospital


a
beautiful
old
building

founded

in
the
time
of
james

by
a
goldsmith
and
jeweller

whom
sir
walter
scott
has
made
famous
in
his

fortunes
of
nigel


after
this

we
got
again
into
the
carriages
and
proceeded
in
the
same
way
as
before

the
pressure
of
the
crowd
being
really
quite
alarming

and
both
i
and
albert
were
quite
terrified
for
the
archers
guard

who
had
very
hard
work
of
it

but
were
of
the
greatest
use

they
all
carry
a
bow
in
one
hand

and
have
their
arrows
stuck
through
their
belts


unfortunately

as
soon
as
we
were
out
of

edinburgh


it
began
to
rain

and
continued
raining
the
whole
afternoon
without
interruption

we
reached

dalmeny


lord
roseberryâ€™s

at
two
oâ€™clock

the
park
is
beautiful

with
the
trees
growing
down
to
the
sea

it
commands
a
very
fine
view
of
the

forth


the

isle
of
may


the

bass
rock


and
of

edinburgh


but
the
mist
rendered
it
almost
impossible
to
see
anything

the
grounds
are
very
extensive

being
hill
and
dale
and
wood

the
house
is
quite
modern

lord
roseberry
built
it

and
it
is
very
pretty
and
comfortable

we
lunched
there

the
roseberrys
were
all
civility
and
attention

we
left
them
about
half
past
three

and
proceeded
home
through

leith



the
view
of

edinburgh

from
the
road
before
you
enter

leith

is
quite
enchanting

it
is

as
albert
said

â€œfairy
like
â€
and
what
you
would
only
imagine
as
a
thing
to
dream
of

or
to
see
in
a
picture

there
was
that
beautiful
large
town

all
of
stone

no
mingled
colours
of
brick
to
mar
it


with
the
bold
castle
on
one
side

and
the

calton
hill

on
the
other

with
those
high
sharp
hills
of

arthurâ€™s
seat

and

salisbury
crags

towering
above
all

and
making
the
finest

boldest
background
imaginable

albert
said
he
felt
sure
the

acropolis

could
not
be
finer

and
i
hear
they
sometimes
call

edinburgh

â€œthe
modern

athens

â€
the
archers
guard
met
us
again
at

leith


which
is
not
a
pretty
town


the
people
were
most
enthusiastic

and
the
crowd
very
great

the
porters
all
mounted

with
curious
scotch
caps

and
their
horses
decorated
with
flowers

had
a
very
singular
effect

but
the
fishwomen
are
the
most
striking
looking
people

and
are
generally
young
and
pretty
women

very
clean
and
very
dutch
looking

with
their
white
caps
and
bright
coloured
petticoats

they
never
marry
out
of
their
class


at
six
we
returned
well
tired






sunday

september
4



we
walked
to
see
the
new
garden
which
is
being
made

and
saw
mackintosh
there

who
was
formerly
gardener
at

claremont


the
view
of

dalkeith


the
village

or
rather
town

from
thence
is
extremely
picturesque

and
albert
says
very
german
looking

we
returned
over
a
rough
sort
of
bridge

made
only
of
planks

which
crosses
the

esk


and
which

with
the
wooded
banks
on
each
side

is
excessively
pretty

received
from
lady
lyttelton
good
accounts
of
our
little
children

at
twelve
oâ€™clock
there
were
prayers
in
the
house

read
by
mr

ramsay

who
also
preached


at
half
past
four
the
duchess
drove
me
out
in
her
own
phaeton

with
a
very
pretty
pair
of
chestnut

bright

and
frosty

oâ€™clock

as
we
came

it
was
a
bright

clear

cold

frosty
morning

as
we
drove
along
we
saw
the

pentlands


which
looked
beautiful

as
did
also

arthurâ€™s
seat


which
we
passed
quite
close
by

the

salisbury
crags


too

are
very
high

bold

and
sharp

before
this
we
saw

craigmillar


we
passed
through
a
back
part
of
the
town

which
is
most
solidly
built


close
by

heriotâ€™s
hospital


and
had
a
very
fine
view
of
the
castle


i
forgot
to
say
that

when
we
visited
the
castle

we
saw
the
regalia

which
are
very
old
and
curious

they
were
lost
for
one
hundred
years


also
the
room
in
which
james
vi

of
scotland
and
the
first
of
england
was
born

such
a
very

very
small
room

with
an
old
prayer
written
on
the
wall

we
had
a
beautiful
view
of

edinburgh

and
the

forth


at

craigleith


only
a
half

the
duke

with
us
all
the
way
as
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county

until
we
arrived
at

dalmeny


where
lord

met
us
and
rode
with
us

at
eleven
we
reached
the

south
queensferry


where
we
got
out
of
our
carriage
and
embarked
in
a
little
steamer

the
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
our
carriages
going
in
another

we
went
a
little
way
up
the

forth


to
see

hopetoun
house


lord
hopetounâ€™s

which
is
beautifully
situated
between

hopetoun

and

dalmeny


we
also
saw

dundas
castle


belonging
to

of
dundas

and
further
on

beyond

hopetoun



blackness
castle


famous
in
history

on
the
opposite
side
you
see
a
square
tower

close
to
the
water

called

rosyth


where
oliver
cromwellâ€™s
mother
was
said
to
have
been
born

and
in
the
distance

dunfermline


where
robert
bruce
is
buried

we
passed
close
by
a
very
pretty
island
in
the

forth


with
an
old
castle
on
it

called

inchgarvie


and
we
could
see
the
forth
winding
beautifully

and
had
a
distant
glimpse
of

edinburgh

and
its
fine
castle

we
landed
safely
on
the
other
side

at

north
queensferry


and
got
into
our
carriages

captain

with
us

the
way
beyond

cowdenbeath


eight
miles


the
first
village
we
passed
through
on

passed
by
sir
p

durhamâ€™s
property


we
changed
horses
at

cowdenbeath


at
a
quarter
past
one
we
entered

kinross
shire


soon
after

the
country
grew
prettier

and
the
hills
appeared
again

partly
wooded

we
passed

loch
leven


and
saw
the
castle
on
the
lake
from
which
poor
queen
mary
escaped

there
the
country
is
rather
flat

and
the
hills
are
only
on
one
side

we
changed
horses
next
at

kinross


soon
after
this

the
mountains

which
are
rather
barren

began
to
appear

then
we
passed
the
valley
of

glen
farg


the
hills
are
very
high
on
each
side

and
completely
wooded
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley

where
a
small
stream
runs
on
one
side
of
the
road

it
is
really
lovely


on
leaving
this
valley
you
come
upon
a
beautiful
view
of

strathearn

and

moncrieffe
hill


we
were
then
in

perthshire

at
the

bridge
of

miles


at
half
past
three
we
reached

dupplin


lord
kinnoullâ€™s

all
the
time
the
views
of
the
hills

and
dales

and
streams
were
lovely

the
last
part
of
the
road
very
bad
travelling

up
and
down
hill


dupplin

is
a
very
fine
modern
house

with
a
very
pretty
view
of
the
hills
on
one
side

and
a
small
waterfall
close
in
front
of
the
house

a
battalion
of
the
42nd
highlanders
was
drawn
up
before
the
house

and
the
men
looked
very
handsome
in
their
kilts

we
each
received
an
address
from
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
county

read
by
lord
kinnoull

and
from
the
provost
and
magistrates
of

perth

then
lunched

the
willoughbys

kinnairds

ruthvens

and
lord
mansfield

and
one
of
his
sisters

with
others

were
there

after
luncheon

we
walked
a
little
way
in
the
grounds

and
then
at
five
oâ€™clock
we
set
off
again

we
very
soon
came
upon

perth


the
situation
of
which
is
quite
lovely

it
is
on
the

tay


with
wooded
hills
skirting
it
entirely
on
one
side

and
hills
are
seen
again
in
the
distance

the
river
winding
beautifully


albert
was
charmed

and
said
it
put
him
in
mind
of
the
situation
of

basle


the
town
itself

which
is
very
pretty

was
immensely
crowded

and
the
people
very
enthusiastic

triumphal
arches
had
been
erected
in
various
places

the
provost
presented
me
with
the
keys

and
albert
with
the
freedom
of
the
city

two
miles
beyond
is

scone


lord
mansfieldâ€™s


a
fine
looking
house
of
reddish
stone


lord
mansfield
and
the
dowager
lady
mansfield
received
us
at
the
door

and
took
us
to
our
rooms

which
were
very
nice






wednesday

september
7



we
walked
out

and
saw
the
mound
on
which
the
ancient
scotch
kings
were
always
crowned

also
the
old
arch
with
james
vi
â€™s
arms

and
the
old
cross

which
is
very
interesting


before
our
windows
stands
a
sycamore
tree
planted
by
james
vi

a
curious
old
book
was
brought
to
us
from

perth


in
which
the
last
signatures
are
those
of
james
i


of
england

and
of
charles
i


and
we
were
asked
to
write
our
names
in
it

and
we
did
so

lord
mansfield
told
me
yesterday
that
there
were
some
people
in
the
town
who
wore
the
identical
dresses
that
had
been
worn
in
charles
i
â€™s
time

at
eleven
oâ€™clock
we
set
off
as
before

we
drove
through
part
of

perth


and
had
a
very
fine
view
of

scone


a
few
miles
on

we
passed
the
field
of
battle
of

luncarty


where
tradition
says
the
danes
were
beaten
by
lord
errollâ€™s
ancestor

we
also
passed
lord
lynedochâ€™s
property

we
then
changed
horses
at
the
â€œnew
innâ€
at

auchtergaven


the

grampians

came
now
distinctly
into
view

they
are
indeed
a
grand
range
of
mountains


to
the
left
we
saw

tullybelton


where
it
is
said
the
druids
used
to
sacrifice
to
bel

there
are
a
few
trees
on
the
top
of
the
mountain


to
the
left

but
more
immediately
before
us

we
saw

birnam


where
once
stood

birnam
wood


so
renowned
in

macbeth


we
passed
a
pretty
shooting
place
of
sir
w

stewartâ€™s

called

rohallion


nearly
at
the
foot
of

birnam


to
the
right
we
saw
the

stormont

and

strathtay


albert
said

as
we
came
along
between
the
mountains

that
to
the
right

where
they
were
wooded

it
was
very
like

thã¼ringen


and
on
the
left
more
like

switzerland



murthly


to
the
right

which
belongs
to
sir
w

stewart

is
in
a
very
fine
situation

with
the

tay

winding
under
the
hill

this
lovely
scenery
continues
all
along
to

dunkeld


lord
mansfield
rode
with
us
the
whole
way


just
outside

dunkeld


before
a
triumphal
arch

lord
glenlyonâ€™s
highlanders

with
halberds

met
us

and
formed
our
guard

a
piper
playing
before
us


dunkeld

is
beautifully
situated
in
a
narrow
valley

on
the
banks
of
the

tay


we
drove
in
to
where
the
highlanders
were
all
drawn
up

in
the
midst
of
their
encampments

and
where
a
tent
was
prepared
for
us
to
lunch
in

poor
lord
glenlyon

received
us

but
he
had
suddenly
become
totally
blind

which
is
dreadful
for
him

he
was
led
about
by
his
wife

it
was
very
melancholy

his
blindness
was
caused
by
over
fatigue

the
dowager
lady
glenlyon

the
mansfields

kinnoulls

buccleuchs

and
many
others
were
there

we
walked
down
the
ranks
of
the
highlanders

and
then
partook
of
luncheon

the
piper
played

and
one
of
the
highlanders
5

danced
the
â€œsword
dance
â€

two
swords
crossed
are
laid
upon
the
ground

and
the
dancer
has
to
dance
across
them
without
touching
them


some
of
the
others
danced
a

we
left

dunkeld

as
we
came

the
highland
guard
marching
with
us
till
we
reached
the
outside
of
the
town

quite
beautiful
all
the
way
to

taymouth

the
two
highest
hills
of
the

grew
higher
and
higher

and
albert
said
it
was
very
swiss
looking
in
some
parts

high
ribbed
mountains
appeared
in
the
distance

higher
than
any
we
have
yet
seen

this
was
near

aberfeldy


nine
miles


which
is
charmingly
situated
and
the
mountains
very
lofty

at
a
quarter
to
six
we
reached

taymouth


at
the
gate
a
guard
of
highlanders

lord
breadalbaneâ€™s
men

met
us


taymouth

lies
in
a
valley
surrounded
by
very
high

wooded
hills

it
is
most
beautiful

the
house
is
a
kind
of
castle

built
of
granite

the

coup
dâ€™å“il

was
indescribable

there
were
a
number
of
lord
breadalbaneâ€™s
highlanders

all
in
the
campbell
tartan

drawn
up
in
front
of
the
house

with
lord
breadalbane
himself
in
a
highland
dress
at
their
head

a
few
of
sir
neil
menziesâ€™
men

in
the
menzies
red
and
white
tartan


a
number
of
pipers
playing

and
a
company
of
the
92nd
highlanders

also
in
kilts

the
firing
of
the
guns

the
cheering
of
the
great
crowd

the
picturesqueness
of
the
dresses

the
beauty
of
the
surrounding
country

with
its
rich
background
of
wooded
hills

altogether
formed
one
of
the
finest
scenes
imaginable

it
seemed
as
if
a
great
chieftain
in
olden
feudal
times
was
receiving
his
sovereign

it
was
princely
and
romantic

lord
and
lady
breadalbane
took
us
upstairs

the
hall
and
stairs
being
lined
with
highlanders

i
revisited
taymouth
last
autumn

on
the
3rd
of
october

from
dunkeld

incognita


with
louise

the
dowager
duchess
of
athole

and
miss
macgregor

as
we
could
not
have
driven
through
the
grounds
without
asking
permission

and
we
did
not
wish
to
be
known

we
decided
upon
not
attempting
to
do
so

and
contented
ourselves
with
getting
out
at
a
gate
close
to
a
small
fort

into
which
we
were
led
by
a
woman
from
the
gardenerâ€™s
house

near
to
which
we
had
stopped

and
who
had
no
idea
who
we
were


we
got
out

and
looked
from
this
height
down
upon
the
house
below

the
mist
having
cleared
away
sufficiently
to
show
us
everything

and
then

unknown

quite
in
private

i
gazed

not
without
deep
emotion

on
the
scene
of
our
reception
twenty
four
years
ago

by
dear
lord
breadalbane

in
a
princely
style

not
to
be
equalled
in
grandeur
and
poetic
effect


albert
and
i
were
then
only
twenty
three

young
and
happy

how
many
are
gone
that
were
with
us
then


i
was
very
thankful
to
have
seen
it
again


it
seemed
unaltered

the
gothic
staircase
is
of

and
very
fine

the
whole
of
the

newly
and
exquisitely
furnished

the
drawing
room

especially

is
splendid

thence
you
go
into
a
passage
and
a
library

which
adjoins
our
private
apartments

showed
us
two
sets
of

chose
those
which

hand
of
the
corridor
or

room

splendidly
illuminated


a
whole
chain
of
lamps
along

the
hills

i
never
saw
anything
so
fairy
like

there
were
some
pretty
fireworks

and
the
whole
ended
by
the
highlanders
dancing
reels

which
they
do
to
perfection

to
the
sound
of
the
pipes

by
torch
light

in

of

albert
went
off
at
half
past
nine
oâ€™clock
to
shoot
with
lord
breadalbane

i
walked
out
with
the
duchess
of
norfolk
along
a
path
overlooking
the

tay


which
is
very
clear

and
ripples
and
foams
along
over
the
stones

the
high
mountains
forming
such
a
rich
background

we
got
up
to
the
dairy

which
is
a
kind
of
swiss
cottage

built
of
quartz

very
clean
and
nice

from
the
top
of
it
there
is
a
very
pretty
view
of

loch
tay



we
returned
home
by
the
way
we
came

it
rained
the
whole
time

and
very
hard
for
a
little
while

albert
returned
at
half
past
three

he
had
had
excellent
sport

and
the
trophies
of
it
were
spread
out
before
the
house

nineteen
roe
deer

several
hares
and
pheasants

and
three
brace
of
grouse

there
was
also
a
capercailzie
that
had
been
wounded

and
which
i
saw
afterwards

a
magnificent
large
bird


albert
had
been
near

aberfeldy


and
had
to
shoot
and
walk
the
whole
way
back

lord
breadalbane
himself
beating

and
300
highlanders
out

we
went
out
at
five

with
lady
breadalbane
and
the
duchess
of
sutherland

we
saw
part
of

loch
tay


and
drove
along
the
banks
of
the

tay

under
fine
trees

and
saw
lord
breadalbaneâ€™s
american
buffaloes






friday

september
9



albert
off
again
after
nine
oâ€™clock

to
shoot

soon
after
he
left
i
walked
out
with
the
duchess
of
norfolk
across
the
iron
bridge

and
along
a
grass
walk
overhanging
the

tay



two
of
the
highland
guard

they
were
stationed
at
almost
every
gate
in
the
park

followed
us

and
it
looked
like
olden
times
to
see
them
with
their
swords
drawn


we
then
walked
to
a
lodge
on
the
same
road

a
fat

good
humoured
little
woman

about
forty
years
old

cut
some
flowers
for
each
of
us

and
the
duchess
gave
her
some
money

saying

â€œfrom
her
majesty
â€
i
never
saw
any
one
more
surprised
than
she
was

she

however

came
up
to
me
and
said
very
warmly

that
my
people
were
delighted
to
see
me
in

scotland


it
came
on
to
rain
very
heavily
soon
afterwards

but
we
walked
on

we
saw
a
woman
in
the
river

with
her
dress
tucked
up
almost
to
her
knees

washing
potatoes


the
rain
ceased
just
as
we
came
home

but
it
went
on
pouring
frequently

albert
returned
at
twenty
minutes
to
three

having
had
very
hard
work
on
the
moors

wading
up
to
his
knees
in
bogs
every
now
and
then

and
had
killed
nine
brace
of
grouse

we
lunched

then
we
went
to
the
drawing
room

and
saw
from
the
window
the
highlanders
dancing
reels

but
unfortunately
it
rained
the
whole
time

there
were
nine
pipers
at
the
castle

sometimes
one

and
sometimes
three
played

they
always
played
about
breakfast
time

again
during
the
morning

at
luncheon

and
also
whenever
we
went
in
and
out

again
before
dinner

and
during
most
of
dinnertime

we
both
have
become
quite
fond
of
the
bagpipes


at
a
quarter
past
five
we
drove
out
with
the
duchess
of
buccleuch
and
the
duchess
of
sutherland

poor
lady
breadalbane
not
being
very
well


lord
breadalbane
riding
the
whole
time
before
us

we
took
a
most
beautiful
drive

first
of
all
along
part
of
the
lake
and
between
the
hills

such
thorough
mountain
scenery


and
with
little
huts

so
low

so
full
of
peat
smoke

that
one
could
hardly
see
anything
for
smoke

we
saw

ben
lawers


which
is
said
to
be
4
000
feet
high

very
well

and
further
on

quite
in
the
distance


ben
more


also
the

glenlyon


and
the
river

lyon


and
many
fine
glens

it
was
quite
dark
when
we
came
home
at
half
past
seven

at
eight
we
dined

lord
and
lady
ruthven
and
lord
and
lady
duncan
dined
here

after
dinner
came
a
number
of
people

about
ninety

and
there
was
a
ball

it
opened
with
a
quadrille

which
i
danced
with
lord
breadalbane

and
albert
with
the
duchess
of
buccleuch

a
number
of
reels
were
danced

which
it
was
very
amusing
and
pretty
to
see






saturday

september
10



we
walked
to
the
dairy
and
back

a
fine
bright
morning

the
weather
the
two
preceding
days
had
been
very
unfortunate

i
drove
a
little
way
with
lady
breadalbane

the
others
walking

and
then
got
out

and
each
of
us
planted
two
trees

a
fir
and
an
oak

we
got
in
again

and
drove
with
the
whole
party
down
to
the
lake

where
we
embarked

lady
breadalbane

the
duchess
of
sutherland
and
lady
elizabeth
went
by
land

but
all
the
others
went
in
boats

with
us
were
lord
breadalbane
and
the
duchess
of
norfolk
and
duchess
of
buccleuch

and
two
pipers
sat
on
the
bow
and
played
very
often

i
have
since
been
reading
in

the
lady
of
the
lake


and
this
passage
reminds
me
of
our
voyage
â€”





â€œsee
the
proud
pipers
on
the
bow





and
mark
the
gaudy
streamers
flow




from
their
loud
chanters
down

and
sweep




the
furrowâ€™d
bosom
of
the
deep





as

rushing
through
the
lake
amain





they
plied
the
ancient
highland
strain
â€

our
row
of
16
miles
up

loch
tay

to

auchmore


a
cottage
of
lord
breadalbaneâ€™s

near
the
end
of
the
lake

was
the
prettiest
thing
imaginable

we
saw
the
splendid
scenery
to
such
great
advantage
on
both
sides


ben
lawers


with
small
waterfalls
descending
its
sides

amid
other
high
mountains
wooded
here
and
there

with

kenmore

in
the
distance

the
view

looking
back

as
the
loch
winds

was
most
beautiful

the
boatmen
sang
two
gaelic
boat
songs

very
wild
and
singular

the
language
so
guttural
and
yet
so
soft

captain
mcdougall

who
steered

and
who
is
the
head
of
the
mcdougalls

showed
us
the
real
â€œbrooch
of
lorn
â€
which
was
taken
by
his
ancestor
from
robert
bruce
in
a
battle

the
situation
of

auchmore

is
exquisite

the
trees
growing
so
beautifully
down
from
the
top
of
the
mountains

quite
into
the
water

and
the
mountains
all
round

make
it
an
enchanting
spot

we
landed
and
lunched
in
the
cottage

which
is
a
very
nice
little
place

the
day
was
very
fine

the
highlanders
were
there
again

we
left

auchmore

at
twenty
minutes
past
three

having
arrived
there
at
a
quarter
before
three

the
kindness
and
attention
to
us
of
lord
and
of
lady
breadalbane

who
is
very
delicate

were
unbounded

we
passed

killin


where
there
is
a
mountain
stream
running
over
large
stones

and
forming
waterfalls


the
country
we
came
to
now
was
very
wild

beginning
at

glen
dochart


through
which
the

dochart

flows

nothing
but
moors
and
very
high
rocky
mountains

we
came
to
a
small
lake
called

i
think


laragilly


amidst
the
wildest
and
finest
scenery
we
had
yet
seen


glen
ogle


which
is
a
sort
of
long
pass

putting
one
in
mind
of
the
prints
of
the

kyber
pass


the
road
going
for
some
way
down
hill
and
up
hill

through
these
very
high
mountains

and
the
escort
in
front
looking
like
mere
specks
from
the
great
height

we
also
saw

ben
voirlich


at

loch
earn
head

we
changed
horses

lord
breadalbane
rode
with
us
the
whole
way
up
to
this
point

and
then
he
put
his
factor

in
highland
dress

up
behind
our
carriage

it
came
on
to
rain

and
rained
almost
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
time

we
passed
along

loch
earn


which
is
a
very
beautiful
long
lake
skirted
by
high
mountains

but
is
not
so
long
or
so
large
as

loch
tay


just
as
we
turned
and
went
by

st

fillans


the
view
of
the
lake
was
very
fine

there
is
a
large
detached
rock
with
rich
verdure
on
it

which
is
very
striking


we
also
saw

glenartney


the
mountain
on
which
lord
willoughby
has
his
deer
forest

we
passed
by
sir
d

dundasâ€™s
place


dunira


before
we
changed
horses
at

comrie


for
the
last
time

and
then
by
mr

williamsonâ€™s

and
by

ochtertyre


sir
w

keith
murrayâ€™s


triumphal
arches
were
erected
in
many
places

we
passed
through

crieff


and
a
little
past
seven
reached

drummond
castle


by
a
very
steep
ascent

lord
willoughby
received
us
at
the
door

and
showed
us
to
our
rooms

which
are
small
but
nice

besides
lord
and
lady
willoughby
and
the
two
misses
willoughby

and
our
own
people

sunday

september
11



we
walked
in
the
garden

which
is
really
very
fine

with
terraces

like
an
old
french
garden

part
of
the
old
castle
and
the
archway
remains


at
twelve
oâ€™clock
we
had
prayers
in
the
drawing
room

which
were
read
by
a
young
clergyman

who
preached
a
good
sermon


it
poured
the
whole
afternoon

and

after
writing

i
read
to
albert
the
three
first
cantos
of

the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel


which
delighted
us
both

and
then
we
looked
over
some
curious

fine
old
prints
by
ridinger

at
eight
we
dined

the
duchess
of
sutherland

monday

september

albert
got
up
at
five
oâ€™clock
to
go
out
deer
stalking

i
walked
out
with
the
duchess
of
norfolk


all
the
highlanders

lord
willoughbyâ€™s
people

110
in
number


were
drawn
up
in
the
court

young
mr

willoughby
and
major
drummond
being
at
their
head

and
i
walked
round
with
lady
willoughby

all
the
arms
they
wore
belonged
to
lord
willoughby

and
there
was
one
double
hilted
sword

which
had
been
at
the
battle
of

bannockburn


i
hear
that
at

dunkeld

there
were
nearly
900
highlanders

500
being

athole

men

and

altogether

with
the
various
highlanders
who
were
on
guard

there
were
1
000
men


at
length

a
little
before
three

to
my
joy

albert
returned

dreadfully
sunburnt

and
a
good
deal
tired

he
had
shot
a
stag

he
said
the
exertion
and
difficulty
were
very
great

he
had
changed
his
dress
at
a
small
farm
house


glenartney

is
ten
miles
from

drummond

monzie

pronounced
â€œmonieâ€


a
young
gentleman
who
has
a
place
near
here

went
with
him
and
was

albert
said

extremely
active

to
give
some
description
of
this
curious
sport

i
will
copy
an
extract
from
a
letter
albert
has
written
to
charles

9

giving
a
short
account
of
it
â€”

â€œwithout
doubt
deer
stalking
is
one
of
the
most
fatiguing

but
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
pursuits

there
is
not
a
tree

or
a
bush
behind
which
you
can
hide
yourself




one
has

therefore

to
be
constantly
on
the
alert
in
order
to
circumvent
them

and
to
keep
under
the
hill
out
of
their
wind

crawling
on
hands
and
knees

and
dressed
entirely
in
grey

half
brother

prince
leiningen

who
died
in
1856


at
half
past
four
we
drove
out
with
lady
willoughby
and
the
duchess
of
buccleuch

we
drove
through

fern
tower


belonging
to
the
widow
of
the
first
sir
d

baird


where
we
stopped
the
carriage

then
to

abercairny


major
morayâ€™s

we
got
out
there
a
moment
to
look
at
the
very
fine
house
he
is
building

then
drove
home
by

monzie


campbell
of
monzieâ€™s


and
sir
w

murrayâ€™s

and
had
a
very
good
view
of
the
highland
hills

a
very
fine
day

at
eight
we
dined

the
belhavens

seftons

cravens

campbell
of
monzie

and
various
others
composed
the
party

after
dinner
more
people
came

several
in
kilts

and
many
reels
were
danced

campbell
of
monzie
is
an
exceedingly
good
dancer

we
danced
one
country
dance

i
with
lord
willoughby

and
albert
with
lady
carington






tuesday

september
13



we
had
to
start
early

and
therefore
got
up
soon
after
seven
oâ€™clock

breakfast
before
eight

at
nine
we
set
off

the
morning
was
very
foggy
and
hazy

we
passed
near
lord
strathallanâ€™s
place
and
stopped
for
a
moment
where
old
lady
strathallan
was
seated

lord
willoughby
rode
with
us
the
whole
way
till
we
arrived
here

soon
after
this
we
came
to
a
very
extraordinary
roman
encampment
at

ardoch


called
the
â€œlindrum
â€
albert
got
out

but
i
remained
in
the
carriage

and
major
moray
showed
it
to
him

they
say
it
is
one
of
the
most
perfect
in
existence


we
changed
horses
at

greenloaning


and
passed
through

dunblane


at
twelve
oâ€™clock
we
reached

stirling


where
the
crowd
was
quite
fearful

and
the
streets
so
narrow

that
it
was
most
alarming

and
order
was
not
very
well
kept

up
to
the
castle

the
road
or
street
is
dreadfully
steep

we
had
a
foot
procession
before
us
the
whole
way

and
the
heat
was
intense

the
situation
of
the
castle
is
extremely
grand

but
i
prefer
that
of

edinburgh
castle


old
sir
archibald
christie
explained
everything
to
us
very
well

we
were
shown
the
room
where
james
ii

killed
douglas

and
the
window
out
of
which
he
was
thrown

the
ceiling
is
most
curious

a
skeleton
was
found
in
the
garden
only
twenty
five
years
ago

and
there
appears
to
be
little
doubt
it
was
douglasâ€™s

from
the
terrace
the
view
is
very
extensive

but
it
was
so
thick
and
hazy

that
we
could
not
see
the
highland
hills
well

sir
a

christie
showed
us
the
field
of
the
battle
of

bannockburn


and
the
â€œknoll
â€
close
under
the
walls
of
the
castle

from
which
the
ladies
used
to
watch
the
tournaments

all
the
embankments
yet
remain

we
also
saw
knoxâ€™s
pulpit


we
next
passed
through

falkirk


and
changed
horses
at

callander
park


mr

forbesâ€™s

both
he
and
sir
michael
bruce
having
ridden
with
us
from
beyond

stirling


we
passed
lord
zetland
on
the
road

and
shortly
before
reaching

linlithgow


where
we
changed
horses

lord
hopetoun
met
us

unfortunately

we
did
not
see
the
palace

which

i
am
told

is
well
worth
seeing

the
duke
of
buccleuch
met
us
soon
after
this

and

accompanied
by
a
large
number
of
his
tenants

rode
with
us
on
horseback
to

dalkeith


we
changed
horses
at

kirkliston


and
lastly
at
the
outskirts
of

edinburgh


there
were
a
good
many
people
assembled
at

edinburgh


but
we
were
unable
to
stop

we
reached

dalkeith

at
half
past
five


the
journey
was
65
miles

and
i
was
very
tired

and
felt
most
happy
that
we
had
safely
arrived
here






dalkeith

wednesday

september
14



this
is
our
last
day
in

scotland


it
is
really
a
delightful
country

and
i
am
very
sorry
to
leave
it

we
walked
out
and
saw
the
fine
greenhouse
the
duke
has
built

all
in
stone

in
the
renaissance
style

at
half
past
three
oâ€™clock
we
went
out
with
the
duchess
of
buccleuch

only
colonel
bouverie
riding
with
us

we
drove
through

melville
park


and
through
one
of
the
little
collier
villages

of
which
there
are
a
great
many
about

dalkeith



called

loanhead


to

rosslyn



we
got
out
at
the
chapel

which
is
in
excellent
preservation

it
was
built
in
the
fifteenth
century

and
the
architecture
is
exceedingly
rich

it
is
the
burying
place
of
the
family
of
lord
rosslyn

who
keeps
it
in
repair

twenty
barons
of
rosslyn
are
buried
there
in
armour

a
great
crowd
had
collected
about
the
chapel
when
we
came
out
of
it


from

rosslyn

we
then
drove
to

hawthornden


which
is
also
beautifully
situated
at
a
great
height
above
the
river

to
our
great
surprise
we
found
an
immense
crowd
of
people
there

who
must
have
run
over
from

rosslyn

to
meet
us


we
got
out

and
went
down
into
some
of
the
very
curious
caves
in
the
solid
rock

where
sir
alexander
ramsay
and
his
brave
followers
concealed
themselves

and
held
out
for
so
long
a
time

the
duchess
told
us
there
were
many
of
these
caves
all
along
the
river
to

rosslyn



we
came
home
through

bonnyrigg


another
collier
village

and
through

dalkeith







thursday

september
15



we
breakfasted
at
half
past
seven
oâ€™clock

and
at
eight
we
set
off

with
the
duchess
of
buccleuch

lord
liverpool

and
lord
hardwicke
following

the
ladies
and
equerries
had
embarked
earlier

the
day
was
very
bright
and
fine

the
arrangements
in

edinburgh


through
which
we
had
to
pass

were
extremely
well
managed

and
excellent
order
was
kept

we
got
out
of
the
carriage
on
the
pier

and
went
at
once
on
board
the
â€œtrident
â€
a
large
steamboat
belonging
to
the
general
steam
navigation
company

the
duke
and
duchess
of
buccleuch

lady
j

scott

the
emlyns

lord
cawdor

and
lady
m

campbell

came
on
board
with
us

and
we
then
took
leave
of
them

we
both
thanked
the
duke
and
duchess
for
their
extreme
kindness

attention

and
hospitality
to
us

which
really
were
very
great

indeed
we
had
felt
ourselves
quite
at
home
at

dalkeith



as
the
fair
shores
of

scotland

receded
more
and
more
from
our
view

we
felt
quite
sad
that
this
very
pleasant
and
interesting
tour
was
over

but
we
shall
never
forget
it


on
board
the
â€œtridentâ€

where
the
accommodation
for
us
was
much
larger
and
better
than
on
board
the
â€œroyal
george
â€
and
which
was
beautifully
fitted
up


were
admiral
sir
e

brace

a
pleasant
old
man

commander
bullock

and
three
other
officers

the
â€œrhadamanthus
â€
with
some
servants
and
carriages

set
off
last
night

as
well
as
the
â€œshearwater
â€
with
lord
liverpool
and
lord
hardwicke
on
board


the
â€œsalamanderâ€

with
mr

and
mrs

anson
on
board


the
â€œfearless
â€
and
the
â€œroyal
georgeâ€
yacht
set
off
at
the
same
time
with
us

but
the
wind
being
against
us

we
soon
lost
sight
of
the
yacht

and

not
very
long
after

of
all
our
steamers

except
the
â€œmonarch
â€
which
belongs
to
the
general
steam
navigation
company

and
had
some
of
our
horses
on
board

it
started
nearly
at
the
same
time

and
was
the
only
one
which
could
keep
up
with
us

we
passed

tantallon
castle


a
grand
old
ruin
on
the
coast

and
quite
close
to
the

bass
rock


which
is
very
fine

and
nearly
opposite

tantallon


it
was
entirely
covered
with
sea
gulls
and
island
geese

which
swarm
in
thousands
and
thousands

quite
whitening
its
sides

and
hovering
above
and
around
it


at
two
oâ€™clock
we
passed
the
famed

st

abbâ€™s
head


which
we
had
so
longed
to
see
on
our
first
voyage
to

scotland


i
read
a
few
stanzas
out
of

marmion


giving
an
account
of
the
voyage
of
the
nuns
to

holy
island


and
saw
the
ruins
of
the
convent
on
it

then

bamborough
castle


and
a
little
further
on
the

ferne
islands


we
were
very
sorry
to
hear
that
poor
grace
darling
had
died
the
night
before
we
passed
the
first
time






friday

september
16



we
heard
that
we
had
passed

flamborough
head

at
half
past
five
in
the
morning

the
â€œblack
eagleâ€
we
passed
at
half
past
eight
last
night

and
we
could
only
just
see
her
smoke
by
the
time
we
came
on
deck

at
half
past
nine
i
followed
albert
on
deck

it
was
a
fine

bright
morning

we
had
some
coffee

and
walked
about

we
were
then
quite
in
the
open
sea

it
was
very
fine
all
day

at
five
we
were
close
to
the
â€œrhadamanthus
â€
which
had
been
in
sight
all
day

we
had
a
very
pleasant
little
dinner
on
deck

in
a
small
tent
made
of
flags

at
half
past
five

we
passed

yarmouth

at
about
a
quarter
to
six

very
flat

and
looking

albert
said

like
a
flemish
town

we
walked
up
and
down
on
deck

admiring
the
splendid
moonlight

which
was
reflected
so
beautifully
on
the
sea


we
went
below
at
half
past
seven

and
i
read
the
fourth
and
fifth
cantos
of

the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel

to
albert

and
then
we
played
on
the
piano






saturday

september
17



at
three
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
we
were
awakened
by
loud
guns

which

however

were
welcome
sounds
to
us

as
we
knew
that
we
were
at
the

nore


the
entrance
of
the
river

about
six
we
heard
the
â€œrhadamanthusâ€
had
just
passed
us

and
they
said
we
were
lying
off

southend


in
order
to
let
the
â€œblack
eagleâ€
come
up

it
was
a
very
bright
day

though
a
little
hazy


the
shipping
in
the
river
looked
very
pretty
as
we
passed
along

at
ten
minutes
past
ten
we
got
into
the
barge
and
landed

the
duchess
of
norfolk
and
miss
matilda
paget
and
the
equerries
were
all
there

but
the
others
we
knew
nothing
of

sir
james
clark
had
been
on
board
the
â€œtridentâ€
with
us

we
drove
off
at
once
to
the
railway
terminus

and
reached

windsor
castle

good
bertie

see
us

vicky

appeared
as
â€œvoyageuse
â€
and
was
all
impatience
to
go

set
off

reached

wednesday

september
11



at
six
oâ€™clock
we
inquired
and
heard
that
we
were
in
the
port
of

dundee


albert
saw
our
other
gentlemen

who
had
had
a
very
bad
passage

tuesday
night
they
had
a
dreadful
storm


dundee

is
a
very
large
place

and
the
port
is
large
and
open

the
situation
of
the
town
is
very
fine

but
the
town
itself
is
not
so

the
provost
and
people
had
come
on
board

and
wanted
us
to
land
later

but
we
got
this
satisfactorily
arranged

at
half
past
eight
we
got
into
our
barge
with
vicky

and
our
ladies
and
gentlemen

the
sea
was
bright
and
blue

the
boat
danced
along
beautifully

we
had
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
row


a
staircase

covered
with
red
cloth

was
arranged
for
us
to
land
upon

and
there
were
a
great
many
people

but
everything
was
so
well
managed
that
all
crowding
was
avoided

and
only
the
magistrates
were
below
the
platform
where
the
people
were

albert
walked
up
the
steps
with
me

i
holding
his
arm
and
vicky
his
hand

amidst
the
loud
cheers
of
the
people

all
the
way
to
the
carriage

our
dear
vicky
behaving
like
a
grown
up
person

not
put
out

nor
frightened

nor
nervous

we
got
into
our
postchaise

and
at
the
same
time
renwick
took
vicky
up
in
his
arms

and
put
her
in
the
next
carriage
with
her
governess
and
nurse


there
was
a
great
crowd
in

dundee


but
everything
was
very
well
managed

and
there
would
have
been
no
crowding
at
all

had
not

as
usual

about
twenty
people
begun
to
run
along
with
the
carriage

and
thus
forced
a
number
of
others
to
follow

about
three
miles
beyond

dundee

we
stopped
at
the
gate
of
lord
camperdownâ€™s
place

here
a
triumphal
arch
had
been
erected

and
lady
camperdown
and
lady
duncan
and
her
little
boy

with
others

were
all
waiting
to
welcome
us

and
were
very
civil
and
kind

the
little
boy

beautifully
dressed
in
the
highland
dress

was
carried
to
vicky

and
gave
her
a
basket
with
fruit
and
flowers

i
said
to
albert
i
could
hardly
believe
that
our
child
was
travelling
with
us

it
put
me
so
in
mind
of
myself
when
i
was
the
â€œlittle
princess
â€
albert
observed
that
it
was
always
said
that
parents
lived
their
lives
over
again
in
their
children

which
is
a
very
pleasant
feeling


the
country
from
here
to

cupar
angus

is
very
well
cultivated

and
you
see
hills
in
the
distance

the
harvest
is
only
now
being
got
in

but
is
very
good

and
everything
much
greener
than
in

england


nothing
could
be
quieter
than
our
journey

and
the
scenery
is
so
beautiful

it
is
very
different
from

england


all
the
houses
built
of
stone

the
people
so
different


sandy
hair

high
cheekbones

children
with
long
shaggy
hair
and
bare
legs
and
feet

little
boys
in
kilts

near

dunkeld


and
also
as
you
get
more
into
the

highlands


there
are
prettier
faces

those
jackets
which
the
girls
wear
are
so
pretty

all
the
men
and
women

as
well
as
the
children

look
very
healthy



cupar
angus

is
a
small
place

a
village

14
miles
from

dundee


there
you
enter

perthshire


we
crossed
the
river

isla


which
made
me
think
of
my
poor
little
dog
â€œisla
â€
for
about
five
or
six
miles
we
went
along
a
very
pretty
but
rough
cross
road

with
the

grampians

in
the
distance

we
saw

birnam
wood

and
sir
w

stewartâ€™s
place
in
that
fine
valley
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river

all
along
such
splendid
scenery

and
albert
enjoyed
it
so
much

rejoicing
in
the
beauties
of
nature

the
sight
of
mountains

and
the
pure
air


the
peeps
of

dunkeld


with
the
river

tay

deep
in
the
bottom

and
the
view
of
the
bridge
and
cathedral

surrounded
by
the
high
wooded
hills

as
you
approached
it

were
lovely
in
the
extreme

we
got
out
at
an
inn

which
was
small

but
very
clean

at

dunkeld


and
stopped
to
let
vicky
have
some
broth

such
a
charming
view
from
the
window

vicky
stood
and
bowed
to
the
people
out
of
the
window

there
never
was
such
a
good
traveller
as
she
is

sleeping
in
the
carriage
at
her
usual
times

not
put
out

not
frightened
at
noise
or
crowds

but
pleased
and
amused

she
never
heard
the
anchor
go
at
night
on
board
ship

but
slept
as
sound
as
a
top


shortly
after
leaving

dunkeld


which
is
20
miles
from

blair


and
15
from

cupar
angus


we
met
lord
glenlyon
in
a
carriage

he
jumped
out
and
rode
with
us
the
whole
way
to

blair



and
a
most
beautiful
road
it
is

six
miles
on

in
the
woods
to
the
left

we
could
see

kinnaird
house


where
the
late
lady
glenlyon

lord
glenlyonâ€™s
mother

who
died
about
two
or
three
months
ago

used
to
live

then
we
passed
the
point
of

logierait


where
there
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
castle


the
old
regality
court
of
the
dukes
of
athole

at

moulinearn

we
tasted
some
of
the
â€œ
athole

brose
â€
which
was
brought
to
the
carriage


we
passed

pitlochrie


a
small
village


faskally


a
very
pretty
place
of
mr

butterâ€™s

to
the
left

and
then
came
to
the

pass
of
killiecrankie


which
is
quite
magnificent

the
road
winds
along
it

and
you
look
down
a
great
height

all
wooded
on

thursday

september
12



we
took
a
delightful
walk
of
two
hours

immediately
near
the
house
the
scenery
is
very
wild

which
is
most
enjoyable

the
moment
you
step
out
of
the
house
you
see
those
splendid
hills
all
round

we
went
to
the
left
through
some
neglected
pleasure
grounds

and
then
through
the
wood

along
a
steep
winding
path
overhanging
the
rapid
stream

these
scotch
streams

full
of
stones

and
clear
as
glass

are
most
beautiful

the
peeps
between
the
trees

the
depth
of
the
shadows

the
mossy
stones

mixed
with
slate


c


which
cover
the
banks

are
lovely

at
every
turn
you
have
a
picture

we
were
up
high

but
could
not
get
to
the
top

albert
in
such
delight

it
is
a
happiness
to
see
him

he
is
in
such
spirits

we
came
back
by
a
higher
drive

and
then
went
to
the
factorâ€™s
house

still
higher
up

where
lord
and
lady
glenlyon
are
living

having
given

blair

up
to
us

we
walked
on

to
a
cornfield
where
a
number
of
women
were
cutting
and
reaping
the
oats

â€œshearingâ€
as
they
call
it
in

scotland



with
a
splendid
view
of
the
hills
before
us

so
rural
and
romantic

so
unlike
our
daily

windsor

walk

delightful
as
that
is


and
this
change
does
such
good

as
albert
observes

it
refreshes
one
for
a
long
time

we
then
went
into
the
kitchen
garden

and
to
a
walk
from
which
there
is
a
magnificent
view

this
mixture
of
great
wildness
and
art
is
perfection


at
a
little
before
four
oâ€™clock
albert
drove
me
out
in
the
pony
phaeton
till
nearly
six

such
a
drive

really
to
be
able
to
sit
in
oneâ€™s
pony
carriage

and
to
see
such
wild

beautiful
scenery
as
we
did

the
farthest
point
being
only
five
miles
from
the
house

is
an
immense
delight

we
drove
along

glen
tilt


through
a
wood
overhanging
the
river

tilt


which
joins
the

garry


and
as
we
left
the
wood
we
came
upon
such
a
lovely
view


ben
y
ghlo

straight
before
us

and
under
these
high
hills
the
river

tilt

gushing
and
winding
over
stones
and
slates

and
the
hills
and
mountains
skirted
at
the
bottom
with
beautiful
trees

the
whole
lit
up
by
the
sun

and
the
air
so
pure
and
fine

but
no
description
can
at
all
do
it
justice

or
give
an
idea
of
what
this
drive
was


oh

what
can
equal
the
beauties
of
nature

what
enjoyment
there
is
in
them

albert
enjoys
it
so
much

he
is
in
ecstasies
here

he
has
inherited
this
love
for
nature
from
his
dear
father


we
went
as
far
as
the

marble
lodge


a
keeperâ€™s
cottage

and
came
back
the
same
way






monday

september
16



after
our
luncheon
at
half
past
three

albert
drove
me

lord
glenlyon
riding
with
us

to
the

falls
of
the
bruar


we
got
out
at
the
road

and
walked
to
the
upper
falls

and
down
again
by
the
path
on
the
opposite
side

it
is
a
walk
of
three
miles
round

and
a
very
steep
ascent

at
every
turn
the
view
of
the
rushing
falls
is
extremely
fine

and
looking
back
on
the
hills

which
were
so
clear
and
so
beautifully
lit
up

with
the
rapid
stream
below

was
most
exquisite

we
threw
stones
down
to
see
the
effect
in
the
water

the
trees
which
surround
the
falls
were
planted
by
the
late
duke
of
athole
in
compliance
with
burnsâ€™s
â€œ
petition

â€
15



15


the
humble
petition
of
bruar
water
to
the
noble
duke
of
athole



the
evening
was
beautiful

and
we
feasted
our
eyes
on
the
ever
changing

splendid
views
of
the
hills
and
vales
as
we
drove
back

albert
said
that
the
chief
beauty
of
mountain
scenery
consisted
in
its
frequent
changes

we
came
home
at
six
oâ€™clock






tuesday

september
17



at
a
quarter
to
four
oâ€™clock
we
drove
out

albert
driving
me

and
the
ladies
and
lord
glenlyon
following
in
another
carriage

we
drove
to
the

pass
of
killiecrankie


which
looked
in
its
greatest
beauty
and
splendour

and
appeared
quite
closed

so
that
one
could
not
imagine
how
one
was
to
get
out
of
it

we
drove
over
a
bridge
to
the
right

where
the
view
of
the
pass
both
ways

with
the

garry

below

is
beautiful

we
got
out
a
little
way
beyond
this
and
walked
on
a
mile
to
the

falls
of
the
tummel


the
stream
of
which
is
famous
for
salmon

these
falls

however

are
not
so
fine

or
nearly
so
high

as
those
of
the

bruar


we
got
home
at
half
past
six

the
day
was
fast
fading

and
the
lights
were
lovely


we
watched
two
stags
fighting
just
under
our
window

they
are
in
an
enclosure

and
roar
incessantly






wednesday

september
18



at
nine
oâ€™clock
we
set
off
on
ponies

to
go
up
one
of
the
hills

albert
riding
the
dun
pony
and
i
the
grey

attended
only
by
lord
glenlyonâ€™s
excellent
servant

sandy
mcara

in
his
highland
dress

we
went
out
by
the
back
way
across
the
road

and
to
the
left
through
the
ford

sandy
leading
my
pony
and
albert
following
closely

the
water
reaching
up
above
sandyâ€™s
knees

we
then
went
up
the
hill
of

tulloch


first
straight
up
a
very
steep
cabbage
field

and
then
in
a
zigzag
manner
round

till
we
got
up
to
the
top

the
ponies
scrambling
up
over
stones
and
everything

and
never
making
a
false
step

and
the
view
all
round
being
splendid
and
most
beautifully
lit
up

we
went
up
to
the
very
highest
top

which
cannot
be
seen
from
the
house
or
from
below

and
from
here
the
view
is
like
a
panorama

you
see
the

falls
of
the
bruar



ben
y
chat



ben
vrackie



ben
y
ghlo


the

killiecrankie
pass


and
a
whole
range
of
distant
hills
on
the
other
side

which
one
cannot
at
all
see
from
below

in
the
direction
of

taymouth

you
also
see

dalnacardoch


the
first
stage
from

blair



blair

itself
and
the
houses
in
the
village
looked
like
little
toys
from
the
great
height
we
were
on

it
was
quite
romantic

here
we
were
with
only
this
highlander
behind
us
holding
the
ponies

for
we
got
off
twice
and
walked
about


not
a
house

not
a
creature
near
us

but
the
pretty
highland
sheep

with
their
horns
and
black
faces


up
at
the
top
of

tulloch


surrounded
by
beautiful
mountains


we
came
back
the
same
way
that
we
went

and
stopped
at
the
ford
to
let
the
ponies
drink
before
we
rode
through

we
walked
from
inside
the
gate

and
came
home
at
half
past
eleven


the
most
delightful

most
romantic
ride
and
walk
i
ever
had

i
had
never
been
up
such
a
mountain

and
then
the
day
was
so
fine

the
hill
of

tulloch

is
covered
with
grass

and
is
so
delightfully
soft
to
walk
upon






thursday

september
19



albert
set
off

immediately
after
luncheon

deer
stalking

and
i
was
to
follow
and
wait
below
in
order
to
see
the
deer
driven
down

at
four
oâ€™clock
i
set
off
with
lady
glenlyon
and
lady
canning

mr

oswald
and
lord
charles
wellesley
riding

by
the
lower

glen
tilt

drive

we
stopped
at
the
end

but
were
still
in
the
wood

sandy
was
looking
out
and
watching

after
waiting
we
were
allowed
to
come
out
of
the
carriage

and
came
upon
the
road

where
we
saw
some
deer
on
the
brow
of
the
hill

we
sat
down
on
the
ground

lady
canning
and
i
sketching

and
sandy
and
mr

oswald

both
in
highland
costume


the
same
that
they
all
wear
here

viz

a
grey
cloth
jacket
and
waistcoat

with
a
kilt
and
a
highland
bonnet


lying
on
the
grass
and
looking
through
glasses

after
waiting
again
some
time

we
were
told
in
a
mysterious
whisper
that
â€œthey
were
coming
â€
and
indeed
a
great
herd

did

appear
on
the
brow
of
the
hill

and
came
running
down
a
good
way

when
most
provokingly
two
men
who
were
walking
on
the
road

which
they
had
no
business
to
have
done

suddenly
came
in
sight

and
then
the
herd
all
ran
back
again
and
the
sport
was
spoilt

after
waiting
some
little
while
we
observed
albert

lord
glenlyon

and
the
keepers
on
the
brow
of
the
hill

and
we
got
into
the
carriage

drove
a
little
way

went
over
the
bridge

where
there
is
a
shepherdâ€™s
â€œshiel
â€
and
got
out
and
waited
for
them
to
join
us

which
they
did
almost
immediately


looking
very
picturesque
with
their
rifles

my
poor
albert
had
not
even
fired
one
shot
for
fear
of
spoiling
the
whole
thing

but
had
been
running
about
a
good
deal

the
group
of
keepers
and
dogs
was
very
pretty

after
talking
and
waiting
a
little
while

we
walked
some
way
on

and
then
albert
drove
home
with
us






saturday

september
21



after
breakfast
albert
saw
lord
glenlyon

who
proposed
that
he
should
go
deer
stalking
and
that
i
should
follow
him

at
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
we
drove
off
with
lady
canning
for

glen
tilt


the
day
was
glorious
and
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
lose
it

but
it
was
a
long
hard
dayâ€™s
work

though
extremely
delightful
and
enjoyable

and
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
done
before

i
should
have
enjoyed
it
still
more
had
i
been
able
to
be
with
albert
the
whole
time


we
drove
nearly
to
peter
fraserâ€™s
house

which
is
between
the

marble
lodge

and

forest
lodge


here
albert
and
i
walked
about
a
little

and
then
lady
canning
and
we
mounted
our
ponies
and
set
off
on
our
journey

lord
glenlyon
leading
my
pony
the
whole
way

peter
fraser

the
head
keeper

a
wonderfully
active
man

leading
the
way

sandy
and
six
other
highlanders
carrying
rifles
and
leading
dogs

and
the
rear
brought
up
by
two
ponies
with
our
luncheon
box

lawley

16

albertâ€™s
jã¤ger

was
also
there

carrying
one
of
albertâ€™s
rifles

the
other
albert
slung
over
his
right
shoulder

to
relieve
lawley

so
we
set
off
and
wound
round
and
round
the
hill

which
had
the
most
picturesque
effect
imaginable

such
a
splendid
view
all
round

finer
and
more
extensive
the
higher
we
went

the
day
was
delightful

but
the
sun
very
hot

we
saw
the
highest
point
of

ben
y
ghlo


which
one
cannot
see
from
below

and
the
distant
range
of
hills
we
had
seen
from

tulloch

was
beautifully
softened
by
the
slightest
haze

we
saw

loch
vach


the
road
was
very
good

and
as
we
ascended
we
had
to
speak
in
a
whisper

as
indeed
we
did
almost
all
day

for
fear
of
coming
upon
deer
unawares

the
wind
was

however

right

which
is
everything
here
for
the
deer

i
wish
we
could
have
had
landseer
with
us
to
sketch
our
party

with
the
background

it
was
so
pretty

as
were
also
the
various
â€œhalts
â€

c

if
i
only
had
had
time
to
sketch
them



16

a
very
good
man

his
health
obliged
him
to
give
up
being
a
jã¤ger
in
1848

he
was
then
appointed
a
page

in
which
position
he
continued
till
he
died

in
november

1865


we
stopped
at
the
top
of
the

ghrianan


whence
you
look
down
an
immense
height

it
is
here
that
the
eagles
sometimes
sit

albert
got
off
and
looked
about
in
great
admiration

and
walked
on
a
little

and
then
remounted
his
pony

we
then
went
nearly
to
the
top
of

cairn
chlamain


and
here
we
separated

albert
going
off
with
peter

lawley

and
two
other
keepers

to
get
a
â€œquiet
shotâ€
as
they
call
it

and
lady
canning

lord
glenlyon

and
i
went
up
quite
to
the
top

which
is
deep
in
moss


here
we
sat
down
and
stayed
some
time
sketching
the
ponies
below

lord
glenlyon
and
sandy
remaining
near
us

the
view
was
quite
beautiful

nothing
but
mountains
all
around
us

and
the
solitude

the
complete
solitude

very
impressive

we
saw
the
range
of

mar
forest


and
the
inner
range
to
the
left

receding
from
us

as
we
sat
facing
the
hill

called

scarsach


where
the
counties
of

perth



aberdeen


and

inverness

join

my
pony
was
brought
up
for
me

and
we
then
descended
this
highest
pinnacle

and
proceeded
on
a
level
to
meet
albert

whom
i
descried
coming
towards
us

we
met
him
shortly
after

he
had
had
bad
luck

i
am
sorry
to
say

we
then
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
had
some
luncheon

then
i
walked
a
little
with
albert
and
we
got
on
our
ponies

as
we
went
on
towards
home
some
deer
were
seen
in

glen
chroine


which
is
called
the
â€œsanctum
â€
where
it
is
supposed
that
there
are
a
great
many

albert
went
off
soon
after
this

and
we
remained
on

sron
a
chro


for
an
hour

i
am
sure

as
lord
glenlyon
said
by
so
doing
we
should
turn
the
deer
to
albert

whereas
if
we
went
on
we
should
disturb
and
spoil
the
whole
thing

so
we
submitted

albert
looked
like
a
little
speck
creeping
about
on
an
opposite
hill

we
saw
four
herds
of
deer

two
of
them
close
to
us

it
was
a
beautiful
sight


meanwhile
i
saw
the
sun
sinking
gradually

and
i
got
quite
alarmed
lest
we
should
be
benighted

and
we
called
anxiously
for
sandy

who
had
gone
away
for
a
moment

to
give
a
signal
to
come
back

we
then
began
our
descent

â€œsquintingâ€
the
hill

the
ponies
going
as
safely
and
securely
as
possible

as
the
sun
went
down
the
scenery
became
more
and
more
beautiful

the
sky
crimson

golden
red
and
blue

and
the
hills
looking
purple
and
lilac

most
exquisite

till
at
length
it
set

and
the
hues
grew
softer
in
the
sky
and
the
outlines
of
the
hills
sharper

i
never
saw
anything
so
fine

it
soon

however

grew
very
dark


at
length
albert
met
us

and
he
told
me
he
had
waited
all
the
time
for
us

as
he
knew
how
anxious
i
should
be

he
had
been
very
unlucky

and
had
lost
his
sport

for
the
rifle
would
not
go
off
just
when
he
could
have
shot
some
fine
harts

yet
he
was
as
merry
and
cheerful
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
disappoint
him

we
got
down
quite
safely
to
the
bridge

our
ponies
going
most
surely

though
it
was
quite
dusk
when
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill

we
walked
to
the

marble
lodge


and
then
got
into
the
pony
carriage
and
drove
home
by
very
bright
moonlight

which
made
everything
look
very
lovely

but
the
road
made
one
a
little
nervous


we
saw
a
flight
of
ptarmigan

with
their
white
wings

on
the
top
of

sron
a
chro


also
plovers

grouse

and
pheasants

we
were
safely
home
by
a
quarter
to
eight






tuesday

october
1



at
a
quarter
past
eight
oâ€™clock
we
started

and
were
very
very
sorry
to
leave

blair

and
the
dear

highlands


every
little
trifle
and
every
spot
i
had
become
attached
to

our
life
of
quiet
and
liberty

everything
was
so
pleasant

and
all
the
highlanders
and
people
who
went
with
us
i
had
got
to
like
so
much

oh

the
dear
hills

it
made
me
very
sad
to
leave
them
behind


lord
glenlyon
rode
with
us

and
we
went
back
exactly
the
same
road
we
came

through

killiecrankie



pitlochrie


saw

logierait



c

the
battle
of

killiecrankie

was
fought
in
a
field
to
your
left

as
you
come
from

blair

and
before
you
come
to
the
pass

and
lord
dundee
was
shot
in
a
garden
immediately
above
the
field
at

urrard


formerly
called

rinrory


which
belongs
to
mr

stewart
of

urrard


the
stewarts
of

urrard

used
formerly
to
live
on

craig
urrard


we
reached

dunkeld

at
half
past
eleven

mr

oswald
and
mr

patrick
small
keir

with
a
detachment
of
highlanders

were
there

we
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
cottage
at

dunkeld

and
got
out
there

it
is
beautifully
situated
and
the
cottage
is
very
pretty

with
a
good
view
of
the
river
from
the
windows


craig
y
barns

is
a
fine
rocky
hill
to
the
left
as
you
drive
from

blair



we
walked
to
look
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
house
which
the
late
duke
of
athole
commenced

but
which
has
been
left
unfinished

and
also
at
a
beautiful
larch
tree

the
first
that
was
brought
to

scotland


i
rode
back
on
â€œarghait
bheanâ€
17

for
the
last
time

and
took
a
sad
leave
of
him
and
of
faithful
sandy
mcara

we
walked
into
the
ruins
of
the
old
cathedral
and
into
that
part
which
the
late
duke
fitted
up
for
service

and
where
there
is
a
fine
monument
of
him

i
should
never
have
recognized
the
grounds
of

dunkeld


so
different
did
they
look
without
the
encampment

18

beautiful
as

dunkeld

is

it
does
not
approach
the
beauty
and
wildness
of

blair




17

this
pony
was
given
to
me
by
the
duke
of
athole
in
1847

and
is
now
alive
at
osborne

after
twelve
oâ€™clock
we
set
off
again

and
to
our
astonishment
lord
glenlyon
insisted
upon
riding
on
with
us
to

dundee


which
is
50
miles
from

blair


captain
j

murray
also
rode
with
us
from

dunkeld


it
made
me
feel
sad
to
see
the
country
becoming
flatter
and
flatter

there
was
a
great
crowd
at

cupar
angus


and
at

dundee

a
still
larger
one

and
on
the
pier
the
crush
was
very
great


we
took
leave
of
lord
glenlyon
with
real
regret

and
he
seemed
quite
unhappy
at
our
going

no
one
could
be
more
zealous
or
kinder
than
he
was


there
was
a
fearful
swell
when
we
went
in
the
barge
to
the
yacht






thursday

october

the
english
coast
appeared
terribly
flat

lord
aberdeen
was
quite
touched
when
i
told
him
i
was
so
attached
to
the
dear

dear

highlands

and
missed
the
fine
hills
so
much

there
is
a
great
peculiarity
about
the

highlands

and
highlanders

and
they
are
such
a
chivalrous

fine

active
people

our
stay
among
them
was
so
delightful

independently
of
the
beautiful
scenery

there
was
a
quiet

a
retirement

a
wildness

a
liberty

and
a
solitude
that
had
such
a
charm
for
us


the
day
had
cleared
up
and
was
bright

but
the
air
very
heavy
and
thick

quite
different
from
the
mountain
air

which
was
so
pure

light

and
brisk

at
two
oâ€™clock
we
reached

woolwich


and
shortly
after
disembarked

we
proceeded
straight
to
the
railroad

and
arrived
at

windsor
castle

at
a
few
minutes
past
four





tour
round
the

wednesday

proceeded
from
the

osborne

two
eldest
children

the

we
were
soon
under
weigh

and
as

osborne

vanished
from
our
sight

i
thought
of
our
poor
children
left
behind






on
board
the
victoria
and
albert



in

thursday

august
12



i
have
not
much
to
relate

our
voyage
has
not
been
what
we
intended


mais
lâ€™homme
propose
et
dieu
dispose


for
instead
of
being
at

falmouth

we
are
only
at

dartmouth


we
started
at
five
oâ€™clock

and
soon
after
felt
the
vessel
stop

and
on
inquiring

heard
that
the
fog
was
so
thick
it
was
impossible
to
proceed

at
last
captain
smithett
was
sent
out
in
the
â€œgarlandâ€
to
report
on
the
state
of
the
weather

and
he
soon
returned

saying
that
all
was
clear
enough
to
proceed
outside

the
needles


we
were
in

alum
bay



so
we
started
again

and

after
breakfast

we
came
on
deck

where
i
remained
working
and
talking

feeling
quite
well

but
towards
one
oâ€™clock
the
ground
swell
had
increased

and
we
decided
to
run
into
the
harbour
we
now
are
in






on
board
the
victoria
and

arrived
here
this
afternoon
at
five

i
will
give
an
account
of
what
has
passed
since
leaving

dartmouth


thursday
evening

after
dining
with
charles

we
went
on
deck

and
found
the
whole
town
illuminated

and
the
effect
of
its
curious
high
houses
running
down
quite
into
the
still
sea

which
reflected
the
illumination

was
lovely


the
night
being
so
fine
and
calm






friday

august
13



we
started
at
four
and
reached
the

scilly
islands

at
three
in
the
afternoon

it
had
been
very
rough

the
numerous
little
rocky
islands

in
the
midst
of
which
we
are
lying

are
very
curious

st

maryâ€™s


the
principal
island

has
a
little
town

a
church

and
a
small
harbour

exactly
opposite

on
the
isle
of

tresco


is
mr

smithâ€™s
house

he
has
the
lease
of
all
the
islands
from
the
duchy
of
cornwall

farther
to
the
left

rocks


albert

who

as
well
as
charles

has
not
been
unwell

while
i
suffered
very
much

went
with
charles
and
bertie
to
see
one
of
the
islands

the
children
recover
from
their
sea
sickness
directly

when
albert
and
the
others
returned

soon
after
five

we
went
with
our
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
barge
across
the
harbour


where

blue
as
the
sea
was

it
was
still
rather
rough


and
landed
at
a
little
pier
at

st

maryâ€™s


the
harbour

surmounted
by
the
old
fort
of
the

star
castle


reminded
me
of
the
harbour
of

st

heliers


we
got
into
a
pony
carriage
belonging
to
mr

smith

with
charles
and
lady
jocelyn

and
drove
through
the
place

which
looks
like
a
small
fishing
town

and
then
round
the
fortifications
of
the
castle

where
there
is
a
very
pretty
walk
overhanging
the
sea

the
rock
being
covered
with
fern

and
heath

and
furze

the
extensive
view
of
the
islands
and
rocks
around
is
very
beautiful

the
town
is
built
upon
a
very
narrow
strip
of
land

with
a
small
bay
on
either
side

we
got
out
at
the
old
castle

which
bears
the
date
of
one
of
the
edwards

the
view
from
the
battlements
is
very
fine

we
returned
the
same
way
we
went

a
little
before
seven






saturday

august
14



we
started
at
five
oâ€™clock

and
the
yacht
then
began
to
roll
and
pitch
dreadfully

and
i
felt
again
very
unwell

but
i
came
on
deck
at
three
in
the
afternoon

the
sea
then
was
like
glass

and
we
were
close
to
the
welsh
coast


this
harbour


milford
haven


is
magnificent

the
largest
we
have

a
fleet
might
lie
here

we
are
anchored
just
off

milford



pembroke

in
front

in
the
distance

the
cliffs

which
are
reddish
brown

are
not
very
high

albert
and
charles
went
in
the
â€œfairyâ€
to

pembroke


and
i
sketched

numbers
of
boats
came
out

with
welshwomen
in
their
curious
high
crowned
menâ€™s
hats

and
bertie
was
much
cheered

for
the
people
seemed
greatly
pleased
to
see
the
â€œprince
of
wales
â€
albert
returned
at
a
quarter
to
eight



illustration


a
very
pretty
dairymaid

in
complete
welsh
costume

was
brought
on
board
for
me
to
see

we
found

milford

illuminated
when
we
went
on
deck

and
bonfires
burning
everywhere






sunday

august
15



we
started
again
at
four
oâ€™clock

but
this
time
had
a
beautiful
day

with
the
sea
smooth
the
whole
way

about
eleven
we
saw
the
mountainous
coast
of

caernarvonshire


the
hills

which
are
in
fact
high
mountains

are
bold
and
finely
shaped

and

albert
said

reminded
him
much
of

ischia


with
the
beautiful
deep
blue
sea
and
bright
sky


having
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the

menai
straits


we
all
left
the
â€œvictoria
and
albert
â€
and
went
on
board
the
â€œfairy
â€
the
â€œvictoria
and
albertâ€
with
the
â€œblack
eagleâ€

the
two
equerries
having
joined
us


the
â€œundineâ€
and
â€œscourge
â€
proceeded
round
the

isle
of
anglesea

by

holyhead


and

in
the
â€œfairy
â€
accompanied
by
the
â€œgarland
â€
we
went
into
the

straits


as
we
entered

the
view
of
the
fine
mountains
with
their
rich
verdure


snowdon

rising
splendidly
in
the
midst

and
of
the
fields
and
woods
below

was
really
glorious

to
the
left
the
country
is
extremely
flat

then

caernarvon

came
in
sight

with
its
grand
old
castle
so
finely
situated

we
stopped
for
a
few
moments
off
here

but
did
not
land

the
mountains
disappeared
for
a
while

and
then
re
appeared
more
beautiful
than
ever

we
passed
close
to

plas
newydd


where
we
had
spent
six
weeks
fifteen
years
ago

i
felt
as
if
i
remembered
it
all
very
well

but
admired
the
scenery
even
more
than
i
had
expected
from
my
previous
recollection


we
passed
the
famous

swilly
rocks


and
saw
the
works
they
are
making
for
the
tube
for
the
railroad

and
then
went
under
the

menai
bridge

and
stopped
immediately
on
the
other
side

there
were
crowds
of
loyal
people
in
steamers
and
boats

playing
â€œgod
save
the
queen
â€
and
cheering
tremendously

albert
and
charles
landed
and
walked
over
the
bridge

when
they
returned
we
went
on
again

and
stopped
in
a
most
beautiful
spot

with
almost
swiss
scenery

opposite

penrhyn
castle


colonel
douglas
pennantâ€™s

which
i
saw
in
the
late
possessorâ€™s
time
unfinished


and
near

bangor


with
its
wooded
banks

through
which
one
can
see
the
high
road
to

beaumaris


the
purple
hills

with
the
verdure
below

and
the
blue
sea

were
extremely
picturesque


albert
and
charles
went
to
see

penrhyn


as
soon
as
they
returned
we
dined
below
in
the
â€œfairy
â€
and
at
eight
we
returned

with
the
children
and
all
our
people

to
the
â€œvictoria
and
albert
â€
the
evening
was
beautiful
and
the
day
very
successful






monday

august
16



we
woke
soon
after
four
oâ€™clock

when
getting
under
weigh

and
were
surprised
to
feel
the
yacht
stop
not
an
hour
after

something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
paddle
wheel

just
as
happened
last
year

and
it
took
full
two
hours
to
set
it
right

then
at
seven
we
started
afresh

a
beautiful
morning
with
a
very
smooth
sea

by
half
past
ten
we
were
in
sight
of
the

isle
of
man


which
is
a
fine
island
with
bold
hills
and
cliffs

a
little
before
twelve
we
reached
the
point
of
the
bay

on
which
is
the
town
of

douglas


very
prettily
situated

with
a
picturesque
castle
near
the
lighthouse

on
the
extreme
point
of
the
bay

we
stopped
off
here
for
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour


the
rocks
were
covered
with
people

from

douglas

to

ramsay
bay

the
hills
and
cliffs
are
high
and
bold

though

ramsay

itself
is
low


for
about
two
hours
we
were
out
of
sight
of
land

and
i
was
below
writing

when
i
came
on
deck
at
three
oâ€™clock
the
scotch
coast
was
quite
close

the

mull
of
galloway


and
then

wigtownshire


albert
declared
he
saw
the
irish
coast

but
i
could
not
descry
it

at
five
we
came
in
sight
of

loch
ryan


and
saw

to
the
left


ailsa
craig

rising
more
than
1
000
feet
perpendicularly
from
the
sea


loch
ryan

is
very
fine

and
the
hills
and
glens
are
lovely

particularly
little

glen
finnart


the
loch
is
very
large

and
the
hills
here
are
very
high
and
wooded

the
little
town
is
called

stranraer







tuesday

august
17



at
six
oâ€™clock
we
began
to
move

a
beautiful
morning

at
about
eight
we
were
close
to
the

ailsa
rock

or

craig


the
formation
of
which
is
very
curious

there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
birds


gannets


on
the
rock

and
we
fired
a
gun
off
three
times
in
order
to
bring
them
in
reach
of
a
shot

albert
and
charles
tried

but
in
vain

we
next
came
in
sight
of
the
beautiful

isle
of
arran


the
finest
point
is
when
you
are
before
the

holy
island


and
in
sight
of
the

goatfell

range
of
mountains

the
highest
is
about
2
800
feet

they
are
peculiarly
fine
from
their
bold
pointed
outlines

before
them
is

lamlash


after
passing

holy
island

we
came
to

brodick
bay


which
is
beautiful

with
high
hills
and
a
glen

in
front
of
which

and
surrounded
by
wood

is
the
castle
which
lord
douglas
is
building

not
long
after
this
we
came
in
sight
of
the

isle
of
bute


and
entered
the

clyde


the
view
of
which
from
mr

stuartâ€™s
and
lord
buteâ€™s
property
is
beautiful

high
wooded
banks

the
river
opening
out
and
widening

surrounded
by
the
distant
mountains

a
small
place
to
the
right
called

largs

is
very
prettily
situated


at
half
past
twelve
we
reached

greenock


the
port
of

glasgow


the
shore
and
the
ships
were
crowded
with
people

there
being
no
less

as
i
since
learnt

than
thirty
nine
steamers

over
filled
with
people

which
almost
all
followed
us

such
a
thing
never
was
seen

add
to
these
steamers
boats
and
ships
of
all
descriptions

moving
in
all
directions

but
not
getting
out
of
the
way

we

however

got
safe
on
board
the
â€œfairy
â€
and
steamed
up
the

clyde


it
was
hazy

and
we
could
not
see
the
distance
well

we
passed
the
small
town
of

port
glasgow


and
about
one
oâ€™clock
were
at

dumbarton
castle


its
situation
is
very
fine

the
rock
rising
straight
out
of
the
river

the
mountains
all
round

and
the
town
of

dumbarton

behind
it

making
it
very
picturesque

we
landed
just
below
the
castle

and
went
with
charles
and
the
children
in
a
carriage
to
the
fort

there
was
a
great
crowd

but
excellent
order
kept

we
went
to
the
battery

but
had
to
mount
many
steps
to
get
to
it

wallace
was
confined
here

and
it
was
one
of
the
last
castles
which
held
out
for
mary
queen
of
scots

from
the
battery
there
is
a
very
extensive
view
of
the

clyde

and

dumbarton


and
we
ought
to
have
been
able
to
see

ben
lomond


but
it
was
in
mist


we
got
back
to
the
â€œfairyâ€
by
half
past
two

and
returned
to

greenock


escorted
by
nineteen
steamers

steamed
past

greenock


and
went
on
towards

loch
long


passing

roseneath

to
the
right

where
the
present
duke
and
duchess
of
argyll
live


loch
long

is
indeed
splendid

15
miles
in
length

surrounded
by
grand
hills

with
such
beautiful
outlines

and
very
green

all
so
different
from
the
eastern
part
of

scotland


the
loch
winding
along
most
beautifully

so
as
to
seem
closed
at
times

charles
said
it
reminded
him
of

switzerland

and
the

tyrol


the
finest
point
of

loch
long

is
looking
towards

loch
goil


we
had
a
very
good
sight
of
the
mountain
called

the
cobbler


the
top
of
which
resembles
a
man
sitting
and
mending
his
shoe

at
the
end
of
the
loch
we
got
a
glimpse
of

ben
lomond


and
were

in
fact

very
near

loch
lomond



we
returned
as
we
came

there
was
no
sun

and
once
or
twice
a
little
mist

but
still
it
was
beautiful

we
went
on
to

rothsay


which
we
reached

a
pretty
little
town

built
round
a
fine
bay

with
hills
in
the
distance

and
a
fine
harbour

when
we
went
on
deck
after
dinner

we
found
the
whole
town
brilliantly
illuminated

with
every
window
lit
up

which
had
a
very
pretty
effect

wednesday

a
bright
fresh
morning

the
hills
slightly
tipped
with
clouds

at
eight
oâ€™clock
we
all
went
on
board
the
â€œfairy
â€
and
went
up
the

kyles
of
bute


which

as
you
advance

become
very
fine

the
hills
lying
so
curiously
one
behind
the
other

sometimes
apparently
closing
up
all
outlet



illustration


we
saw

arran

to
the
left

looking
very
grand
in
the
distance

we
have
been
turning
about
a
good
deal
since
yesterday

for
we
went
by

arran

and

holy
island


and
then
left

little

and

great
cumbray

to
our
left

and
went
up
to

dumbarton

and
back

and
on
to

loch
long


and
then
to

rothsay


leaving

arran

to
our
left

then

after
passing

arran


we
entered

loch
fyne


i

however

had
a
headache

and
was
obliged
to
lie
down
below

and
only
came
on
deck
again
when
we
were
within
an
hour
of

inverary


where
the
lake
widens

and
the
hills
on
either
side
are
very
green
and
undulating

but
not
very
high


the
approach
to

inverary

is
splendid

the
loch
is
very
wide

straight
before
you
a
fine
range
of
mountains
splendidly
lit
up


green

pink

and
lilac

to
the
left
the
little
town
of

inverary


and
above
it

surrounded
by
pine
woods

stands
the
castle
of

inverary


square

with
turrets
at
the
corners


our
reception
was
in
the
true
highland
fashion

the
duke
and
duchess
of
argyll

dear
lady
elizabeth

lady
caroline
leveson
gower

and
the
blantyres
received
us
at
the
landing
place

which
was
all
ornamented
with
heather

the
celtic
society

including
campbell
of
islay

his
two
sons

one
grown
up
and
the
other
a
very
pretty
little
boy


with
a
number
of
his
men

and
several
other
campbells

were
all
drawn
up
near
to
the
carriage

we
got
into
a
carriage
with
the
two
duchesses

charles
and
the
duke
being
on
the
box

we
had
left
the
children
on
board
the
â€œfairyâ€


and
took
a
beautiful
drive
amongst
magnificent
trees

and
along
a
glen
where
we
saw

ben
sheerar



c

the
weather
was
particularly
fine

and
we
were
much
struck
by
the
extreme
beauty
of

inverary


presenting
as
it
does
such
a
combination
of
magnificent
timber

with
high
mountains

and
a
noble
lake


the
pipers
walked
before
the
carriage

and
the
highlanders
on
either
side

as
we
approached
the
house

outside
stood
the
marquis
of
lorn

just
two
years
old

a
dear

white

fat

fair
little
fellow
with
reddish
hair

but
very
delicate
features

like
both
his
father
and
mother

he
is
such
a
merry

independent
little
child

he
had
a
black
velvet
dress
and
jacket

with
a
â€œsporran
â€
scarf

and
highland
bonnet

we
lunched
at
two
with
our
hosts

the
highland
gentlemen
standing
with
halberds
in
the
room

we
sent
for
our
children

who
arrived
during
luncheon
time

we
left

inverary

before
three

and
took
the
children
with
us
in
the
carriage

the
argylls

the
duchess
of
sutherland

and
the
others

accompanied
us
on
board
the
â€œfairy
â€
where
we
took
leave
of
them


the
light
on
the
hills
was
beautiful
as
we
steamed
down

loch
fyne


at
five
we
reached

lochgilp


and
all
landed
at

lochgilphead


a
small
village
where
there
were
numbers
of
people

and

amongst
others

sir
john
p

orde

who
lent
his
carriage
and
was
extremely
civil

we
and
our
people
drove
through
the
little
village
to
the

crinan
canal


where
we
entered
a
most
magnificently
decorated
barge

drawn
by
three
horses

ridden
by
postilions
in
scarlet

we
glided
along
very
smoothly

and
the
views
of
the
hills

the
range
of

cruachan


were
very
fine
indeed

but
the
eleven
locks
we
had
to
go
through


a
very
curious
process

first
passing
several
by
rising

and
then
others
by
going
down


were
tedious

and
instead
of
the
passage
lasting
one
hour
and
a
half

it
lasted
upwards
of
two
hours
and
a
half

therefore
it
was
nearly
eight
oâ€™clock
before
we
reached

loch
crinan


we
instantly
went
on
board
the
â€œvictoria
and
albert
â€
but
it
was
too
late
to
proceed
to

oban


we
had

therefore

to
lengthen
our
voyage
by
a
day

and
spent
the
night
at

crinan


it
is
a
very
fine
spot

hills
all
round

and

in
the
distance

those
of
the
island
of

jura


the
yacht
had
had
a
good
passage
round
the

mull
of
cantire


we
dined
with
charles

and
went
on
deck

and
the
blaze
of
the
numerous
bonfires

the
half
moon

the
stars

and
the
extreme
stillness
of
the
night

had
a
charming
effect






thursday

august
19



a
beautiful
day

at
nine
oâ€™clock
we
left

crinan


proceeding
to
the
right

up
splendid
passes

with
myriads
of
islands

and
such
enchanting
views

that
i
cannot
enumerate
them

we
passed
first
up
the

sound
of
jura


where
numbers
of
people
met
us
in
small
boats

decorated
with
little
flags

then
up
the

pass
of
kerrera

to

oban


one
of
the
finest
spots
we
have
seen

with
the
ruins
of
the
old

castle
of
dunolly

and
a
range
of
high
mountains
in
the
distance

to
the
left

after
leaving

oban


we
saw
the

isle
of
kerrera


and
to
the
right

dunstaffnage
castle


whence
came
the
famous
stone
which
supports
the
â€œcoronation
chair
â€
in
which
the
sovereigns
are
crowned
at

westminster
abbey


alexander
ii

is
said
to
be
buried
here

we
passed
close
by
the
flat
rock

called

the
ladyâ€™s
rock


on
which
a
mclean
left
his
wife

hoping
she
would
be
washed
away

she
was
saved
however


we
then
came
into
the

sound
of
mull

by

tobermory


a
small
place
prettily
situated

and
from
thence
the
views
continued
beautiful

at
one
oâ€™clock
we
were
in
sight
of
the

isles
of
rum



eig

and

muck


rather
large
islands

which
lord
salisbury
bought
a
few
years
ago


next
we
passed
the
long

flat

curious
islands
of

coll

and

tiree


the
inhabitants
of
these
islands
have

unhappily

been
terrible
sufferers
during
the
last
winter
from
famine

a
little
further
on
we
saw

to
our
right

the

treshinish
isles


very
curiously
shaped
rocks

one
is
called

the
dutchmanâ€™s
cap


and
has
the
most
strange
shape

thus




illustration


at
three
we
anchored
close
before

staffa


and
immediately
got
into
the
barge
with
charles

the
children

and
the
rest
of
our
people

and
rowed
towards
the
cave

as
we
rounded
the
point

the
wonderful
basaltic
formation
came
in
sight

the
appearance
it
presents
is
most
extraordinary

and
when
we
turned
the
corner
to
go
into
the
renowned

fingalâ€™s
cave


the
effect
was
splendid

like
a
great
entrance
into
a
vaulted
hall

it
looked
almost
awful
as
we
entered

and
the
barge
heaved
up
and
down
on
the
swell
of
the
sea

it
is
very
high

but
not
longer
than
227
feet

and
narrower
than
i
expected

being
only
40
feet
wide

the
sea
is
immensely
deep
in
the
cave

the
rocks

under
water

were
all
colours

pink

blue

and
green

which
had
a
most
beautiful
and
varied
effect

it
was
the
first
time
the
british
standard
with
a
queen
of
great
britain

and
her
husband
and
children

had
ever
entered

fingalâ€™s
cave


and
the
men
gave
three
cheers

which
sounded
very
impressive
there

we
backed
out

and
then
went
on
a
little
further
to
look
at
the
other
cave

not
of
basaltic
formation

and
at
the
point
called

the
herdsman


the
swell
was
beginning
to
get
up

and
perhaps
an
hour
later
we
could
not
have
gone
in


we
returned
to
the
yacht

but
albert
and
charles
landed
again
at

staffa


they
returned
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour

and
we
then
went
on
to

iona


here
albert
and
charles
landed

and
were
absent
an
hour

i
and
the
ladies
sketched

we
saw
from
the
yacht
the
ruins
of
the
old
cathedral
of

st

oran


when
albert
and
charles
returned

they
said
the
ruins
were
very
curious

there
had
been
two
monasteries
there

and
fine
old
crosses
and
tombs
of
ancient
kings
were
still
to
be
seen

i
must
see
it
some
other
time

on
albertâ€™s
return
we
went
on
again

and
reached

tobermory

at
nine

the
place
was
all
illuminated






friday

august
20



a
wet
morning
when
we
rose
at
half
past
seven

and
it
was
pouring
with
rain
when
we
left

tobermory

at
half
past
eight

i
went
down

and
drew
and
painted

it
cleared
up
about
half
past
ten

and
i
came
on
deck

the
scenery
in

loch
linnhe

was
magnificent

such
beautiful
mountains

from

loch
linnhe

we
entered

loch
eil


and
passed
the
entrance
of

loch
leven

to
the
right

at
the
end
of
which
is

glencoe


so
famous
for
its
beautiful
scenery
and
for
the
horrible
massacre
of
the
macdonalds

in
william
iii
â€™s
time


a
little
before
one
we
arrived
at

fort
william


a
very
small
place

the
afternoon
was
very
bright

and
the
scenery
fine

after
luncheon
albert
and
charles
set
off
in
the
â€œfairyâ€
to
see

glencoe


they
returned
at
twenty
minutes
past
seven

and
albert
thought

glencoe

was
very
fine

though
not
quite
as
much
so
as
he
had
expected

they
had
driven
in
an
extraordinary
carriage

with
seats
for
thirty

the
people

who
recognized
albert

were
so
loyal
that
they
took
the
horses
out
and
insisted
on
drawing
the
carriage


the
evening
was
excessively
cold
and
showery


i
am
quite
sorry
we
shall
have
to
leave
our
yacht
to
morrow

in
which
we
have
been
so
comfortably
housed

and
that
this
delightful
voyage
and
tour
among
the
western
lochs
and
isles
is
at
an
end

they
are
so
beautiful


and
so
full
of
poetry
and
romance

traditions

and

alas

a
very
wet
morning

we
were
ready
long
before
nine
oâ€™clock

but
had
to
wait

as
our
carriages
were
not
ready

at
last
we
all
landed
at

fort
william


where
there
was
a
great
gathering
of
highlanders

in
their
different
tartans

with
lord
lovat
and
mr

stuart
mackenzie
at
their
head

we
got
into
our
carriage
with
charles
and
the
two
children

there
was
a
great
crowd
to
see
us
off

we
went
by
a
very
wild
and
lonely
road

the
latter
part
extremely
fine

with
mountains
and
streams
that
reminded
us
of

glen
tilt


we
changed
horses
only
once

and
came
at
length
in
sight
of

loch
laggan


it
is
a
beautiful
lake

small
in
comparison
to
what
we
have
seen

surrounded
by
very
fine
mountains

the
road
by
its
side
is
extremely
pretty

we
saw
lord
abercornâ€™s
house
of

ardverikie

long
before
we
came
to
it

at

laggan

there
is
only
a
small
inn

and
at
the
end
of
the
lake

a
ferry

here

in
spite
of
the
pouring
rain

were
assembled
a
number
of
highlanders

with
macpherson
of
cluny

always
called
cluny
macpherson

and
three
dear
little
boys
of
his

davidson
of
tulloch

and
others

with
lord
abercorn

in
full
highland
dress

we
stepped
out
of
our
carriage
and
stood
upon
the
floating
bridge

and
so
crossed
over
in
two
or
three
minutes

we
then
drove
on

in
our
pony
carriages

to

ardverikie


and
arrived
there
in
about
twenty
minutes

it
is
quite
close
to
the
lake

and
the
view
from
the
windows

as
i
now
write

though
obscured
by
rain

is
very
beautiful

and
extremely
wild

there
is
not
a
village

house

or
cottage
within
four
or
five
miles

one
can
only
get
to
it
by
the
ferry

or
by
rowing
across
the
lake

the
house
is
a
comfortable
shooting
lodge

built
of
stone

with
many
nice
rooms
in
it

stagsâ€™
horns
are
placed
along
the
outside
and
in
the
passages

and
the
walls
of
the
drawing
room
and
ante
room
are
ornamented
with
beautiful
drawings
of
stags

by
landseer


there
is
little
to
say
of
our
stay
at

ardverikie


the
country
is
very
fine

but
the
weather
was
most
dreadful


on
the
28th

about
five
oâ€™clock

albert
drove
me
out
across
the
ferry

along
the

kingussie

road

and
from
here
the
scenery
was
splendid

high
bold
hills

with
a
good
deal
of
wood

glens

with
the

pattock


and
a
small
waterfall

the
meadows
here
and
there

with
people
making
hay

and
cottages
sprinkled
sparingly
about

reminded
us
much
of

thã¼ringen


we
drove
to
the
small
farm

where
colonel
macpherson
now
lives

called

strathmashie


and
back
again

16
miles
in
all

we
were
delighted
with
the
scenery

which
is
singularly
beautiful

wild
and
romantic


with
so
much
fine
wood
about
it

which
greatly
enhances
the
beauty
of
a
landscape

albert
left
at
six
this
morning
to
go
to

inverness

and
see
the

caledonian
canal







friday

september
17



at
two
oâ€™clock
i
left

ardverikie

with
the
children

and
reached

fort
william

at
half
past
six

where
i
had
the
happiness
of
finding
albert
on
board
the
yacht

all
had
gone
off
well

but
the
weather
had
been
very
bad

albert
said

dochfour

beautiful

the
house
new
and
very
elegant

with
a
fine
garden

and
mr

and
lady
georgiana
baillie
very
pleasant
people


albert
had
to
go
to

inverness


and
to
stay
for
a
ball
that
was
held
there

and
he
was
everywhere
extremely
well
received

this
morning
he
saw
the

falls
of
foyers


which

he
tells
me

are
very
grand
indeed

and
of
a
great
height

and
he
says
that
the

caledonian
canal

is
a
most
remarkable
work

saturday

september
18



at
five
oâ€™clock
we
left

fort
william


rather
a
fine
morning

but
very
squally

and
the
sea
rough

even
where
we
were

when
we
came
on
deck

we
were
close
to
the

isle
of
jura


which
has
such
a
fine

bold
outline

we
went
on
to

loch
crinan


where
we
got
into
the
barge

here
it
was
very
rough
and
pouring
with
rain

so
unlike
the
beautiful
evening
when
we
were
here
a
month
ago

we
landed
at

crinan


mr

malcolm

whose
castle
is
just
opposite

received
us
there

and
we
entered
the
canal
boat
at
ten

we
proceeded
more
quickly
than
the
last
time

the
people
kept
running
along
as
before

and
there
was
a
piper
at
each
lock

it
rained
almost
the
whole
time

we
reached

lochgilphead

at
twelve

in
pouring
rain

and
embarked
on
board
the
â€œblack
eagle
â€
the
yacht
had
again
to
go
round
the

mull
of
cantire

and
meet
us
at

campbeltown


what
a
contrast
to
the
weather
we
had
when
we
came


we
got
under
weigh

and
proceeded
by

kilbrannan
sound

and

arran


we
went
on
deck
for
a
little
while

but
were
driven
below
by
the
rain

later

however

it
was
possible
to
keep
on
deck

we
reached

campbeltown


a
small
and
not
pretty
place

at
the
foot
of

cantire


at
twenty
minutes
to
five

about
half
an
hour
after
we
arrived
the
yacht
came
in

with
the
â€œgarland
â€
â€œfairy
â€
and
â€œscourge
â€
and
we
immediately
went
on
board

they
had
had
a
very
bad
passage

and
captain
crispin
said
he
was
very
glad
that
we
had
not
been
on
board
the
â€œvictoria
and
albert
â€
this
rather
alarmed
us
for
the
next
dayâ€™s
voyage

the
more
so
as
the
evening
was
squally
and
the
sky
very
unpromising

there
was
a
long
consultation
as
to
what
was
to
be
done

and
at
last
it
was
decided
that
we
should
start
at
four
in
the
morning

and
if
it
were
very
rough

we
should
either
run
into

loch
ryan


the

mull
of
galloway


the

bay
of
ramsay


or
into

douglas

in
the

isle
of
man







loch
ryan

sunday

september
19



we
set
off
at
four
oâ€™clock

the
yacht
rolling
considerably

but
it
was
quite
bearable

however

at
seven
they
came
to
shut
down
the
port
holes

expecting
a
heavy
sea

and
lord
adolphus
saw
albert

who
had
just
got
up

and
said
it
would
be
very
rough

upon
which
it
was
decided
to
put
back
a
little
way

and
to
go
into

loch
ryan


we
accordingly
did
so

and
anchored
there
at
half
past
eight


such
a
dreary
rainy
day

one
could
hardly
recognize
what
was
so
fine
when
we
were
last
in
here


both
now

and
the
time
before
when
we
were
in

loch
ryan


lord
orkney
very
civilly
sent
us
game
and
all
sorts
of
things


at
twelve
oâ€™clock
lord
adolphus
read
the
short
sea
service

we
then
talked
over
our
voyage

and
what
could
be
done


the
day
was
very
wretched


pouring
with
rain
and
blowing
hard

it
was
at
last
decided
to
start
again
at
three

and
get
this
evening
to
the

mull
of
galloway


which
would
only
take
us
three
hours

though
it
would
probably
be
rough

as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
the
loch
the
yacht
began
to
pitch

and
the
sea
was
dreadfully
rough

i
was
very
ill

albert

however

stood
it
perfectly

and
the
children
very
tolerably

presently
we
came
in
sight
of
the

mull
of
galloway


a
great
rock
with
a
lighthouse
on
it


and
this
was
our
last
glimpse
of
dear

scotland







monday

september
20



at
six
oâ€™clock
we
got
under
weigh

and
after
considerable
â€œrockings
â€
which
lasted
for
nearly
two
hours

we
were
near
the

isle
of
man


in
smooth
water

and
at
half
past
eight
anchored
in

ramsay
bay



albert
went
on
shore

and
meantime
the
bishop
of
sodor
and
man

with
others

came
on
board

albert
returned
at
twelve

at
one
oâ€™clock
we
started
again

we
had
to
go
slowly
at
first

as
our
paddle
wheel
again
got
wrong

and
because
we
should
otherwise
have
arrived
before
we
were
expected


we
anchored
at
seven
in

fleetwood
harbour


the
entrance
was
extremely
narrow
and
difficult

we
were
lashed
close
to
the
pier

to
prevent
our
being
turned
by
the
tide

and
when
i
went
on
deck
there
was
a
great
commotion

such
running
and
calling

and
pulling
of
ropes


c

it
was
a
cheerless
evening

blowing
hard






tuesday

september
21



at
ten
oâ€™clock
we
landed

and
proceeded
by
rail
to

london







life

the
highlands

to
1861

of
brown
heath
and
shaggy
wood





land
of
the
mountain
and
the
flood





land
of
my
sires

what
mortal
hand




can
eâ€™er
untie
the
filial
band




that
knits
me
to
thy
rugged
strand





still

as
i
view
each
well
known
scene





think
what
is
now

and
what
hath
been





seems
as

to
me

of
all
bereft





sole
friends
thy
woods
and
streams
are
left





and
thus
i
love
them
better
still

friday

september
8

1848



we
arrived
at

balmoral

at
a
quarter
to
three

it
is
a
pretty
little
castle
in
the
old
scottish
style

there
is
a
picturesque
tower
and
garden
in
front

with
a
high
wooded
hill

at
the
back
there
is
wood
down
to
the

dee


and
the
hills
rise
all
around


there
is
a
nice
little
hall

with
a
billiard
room

next
to
it
is
the
dining
room

upstairs

ascending
by
a
good
broad
staircase

immediately
to
the
right

and
above
the
dining
room

is
our
sitting
room

formerly
the
drawing
room


a
fine
large
room

next
to
which
is
our
bed
room

opening
into
a
little
dressing
room
which
is
albertâ€™s

opposite

down
a
few
steps

are
the
childrenâ€™s
and
miss
hildyardâ€™s
three
rooms

the
ladies
live
below

and
the
gentlemen
upstairs


we
lunched
almost
immediately

and
at
half
past
four
we
walked
out

and
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
wooded
hill
opposite
our
windows

where
there
is
a
cairn

and
up
which
there
is
a
pretty
winding
path

the
view
from
here

looking
down
upon
the
house

is
charming

to
the
left
you
look
towards
the
beautiful
hills
surrounding

loch
na
gar


and
to
the
right

towards

ballater


to
the
glen

or
valley

along
which
the

dee

winds

with
beautiful
wooded
hills

which
reminded
us
very
much
of
the

thã¼ringerwald


it
was
so
calm

and
so
solitary

it
did
one
good
as
one
gazed
around

and
the
pure
mountain
air
was
most
refreshing

all
seemed
to
breathe
freedom
and
peace

and
to
make
one
forget
the
world
and
its
sad
turmoils


the
scenery
is
wild

and
yet
not
desolate

and
everything
looks
much
more
prosperous
and
cultivated
than
at

laggan


then
the
soil
is
delightfully
dry

we
walked
beside
the

dee


a
beautiful

rapid
stream

which
is
close
behind
the
house

the
view
of
the
hills
towards

invercauld

is
exceedingly
fine


when
i
came
in
at
half
past
six

albert
went
out
to
try
his
luck
with
some
stags
which
lay
quite
close
in
the
woods

but
he
was
unsuccessful

they
come
down
of
an
evening
quite

saturday

september
16

1848



at
half
past
nine
oâ€™clock
albert
and
i
set
off
in
a
postchaise

and
drove
to
the
bridge
in
the
wood
of

balloch
buie


about
five
miles
from

balmoral


where
our
ponies
and
people
were

here
we
mounted

and
were
attended
by
a
keeper
of
mr

farquharsonâ€™s
as
guide

macdonald
20


who

with
his
shooting
jacket

and
in
his
kilt

looked
a
picture

grant

on
a
pony

with
our
luncheon
in
two
baskets

and
batterbury
22

on
another
pony

we
went
through
that
beautiful
wood
for
about
a
mile

and
then
turned
and
began
to
ascend
gradually

the
view
getting
finer
and
finer

no
road

but
not
bad
ground

moss

heather

and
stones

albert
saw
some
deer
when
we
had
been
out
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour

and
ran
off
to
stalk
them

while
i
rested

but
he
arrived
just
a
minute
too
late

he
waited
for
me
on
the
other
side
of
a
stony
little
burn

which
i
crossed
on
my
pony

after
our
faithful
highlanders
had
moved
some
stones
and
made
it
easier

we
then
went
on
a
little
way

and
i
got
off
and
walked
a
bit

and
afterwards
remounted

macdonald
leading
my
pony

the
view
of

ben
na
bhourd


and
indeed
of
all
around

was
very
beautiful

but
as
we
rose
higher
we
saw
mist
over

loch
na
gar


albert
left
me
to
go
after
ptarmigan

and
went
on
with
grant

while
the
others
remained
with
me

taking
the
greatest
care
of
me

macdonald
is
a
good
honest
man

was
indefatigable

a
groom

now
dead
some
years

who
followed
me
in
his
ordinary
dress

with
thin
boots
and
gaiters

and
seemed
anything
but
happy

he
hardly
ever
attended
me
after
this


i
saw
ptarmigan
get
up

and
albert
fire

he
then
disappeared
from
my
sight

and
i
rode
on

it
became
cold
and
misty
when
we
were
on

loch
na
gar


in
half
an
hour

or
rather
less

albert
rejoined
me
with
two
ptarmigan

having
come
up
by
a
shorter
way

here
it
was
quite
soft

easy
walking

and
we
looked
down
on
two
small
lochs
called

na
nian


which
were
very
striking

being
so
high
up
in
the
hills

albert
was
tired

and
remounted
his
pony

i
had
also
been
walking
a
little
way

the
ascent
commenced

and
with
it
a
very
thick
fog

and
when
we
had
nearly
reached
the
top
of

loch
na
gar


the
mist
drifted
in
thick
clouds
so
as
to
hide
everything
not
within
one
hundred
yards
of
us

near
the
peak

the
fine
point
of
the
mountain
which
is
seen
so
well
from
above
grantâ€™s
house

we
got
off
and
walked

and
climbed
up
some
steep
stones

to
a
place
where
we
found
a
seat
in
a
little
nook

and
had
some
luncheon

it
was
just
two
oâ€™clock

so
we
had
taken
four
hours
going
up


but

alas

nothing
whatever
to
be
seen

and
it
was
cold

and
wet

and
cheerless

at
about
twenty
minutes
after
two
we
set
off
on
our
way
downwards

the
wind
blowing
a
hurricane

and
the
mist
being
like
rain

and
everything
quite
dark
with
it

bowman

mr

farquharsonâ€™s
keeper

and
macdonald

who
preceded
us

looked
like
ghosts

we
walked
some
way
till
i
was
quite
breathless

and
remounted
my
pony

well
wrapped
up
in
plaids

and
we
came
down
by
the
same
path
that
albert
had
come
up

which
is
shorter

but
steeper

the
pony
went
delightfully

but
the
mist
made
me
feel
cheerless


albert
kept
ahead
a
little
while
for
ptarmigan

but
he
gave
it
up
again

when
we
had
gone
on
about
an
hour
and
a
quarter

or
an
hour
and

a
half

the
fog
disappeared
like
magic

and
all
was
sunshine
below

about
one
thousand
feet
from
the
top
i
should
say

most
provoking


and
yet
one
felt
happy
to
see
sunshine
and
daylight
again


the
view

as
one
descends

overlooking

invercauld

and
the
wood
which
is
called

balloch
buie


is
most
lovely

we
saw
some
deer
in
the
wood
below

we
rode
on
till
after
we
passed
the
burn

and
had
nearly
got
to
the
wood

we
came
another
way
down

by
a
much
rougher
path

and
then

from
the
road
in
the
wood

we
walked
up
to
the

falls
of
the
garbhalt


which
are
beautiful

the
rocks
are
very
grand

and
the
view
from
the
little
bridge

and
also
from
a
seat
a
little
lower
down

is
extremely
pretty

we
found
our
carriages
in
the
road

and
drove
home
by
six
oâ€™clock


we
met
captain
gordon

and
then
lord
john
russell
and
sir
james
clark

they
had
come
to
look
after
us

and
when
we
got
home
we
found
the
two
ladies
at
the
door
waiting
most
anxiously
for
us





a
â€œdriveâ€
in
the
balloch
buie






september
18

1848



at
a
quarter
past
ten
oâ€™clock
we
set
off
in
a
postchaise
with
bertie

and
drove
beyond
the
house
of
mr

farquharsonâ€™s
keeper
in
the

balloch
buie


we
then
mounted
our
ponies

bertie
riding
grantâ€™s
pony
on
the
deer
saddle

and
being
led
by
a
gillie

grant
walking
by
his
side

macdonald
and
several
gillies
were
with
us

and
we
were
preceded
by
bowman
and
old
arthur
farquharson

a
deer
stalker
of
invercauldâ€™s

they
took
us
up
a
beautiful
path
winding
through
the
trees
and
heather
in
the

balloch
buie


but
when
we
had
got
about
a
mile
or
more
they
discovered
deer

a
â€œcouncil
of
warâ€
was
held
in
a
whisper

and
we
turned
back
and
went
the
whole
way
down
again

and
rode
along
to
the
keeperâ€™s
lodge

where
we
turned
up
the
glen
immediately
below

craig
daign


through
a
beautiful
part
of
the
wood

and
went
on
along
the
track

till
we
came
to
the
foot
of
the
craig

where
we
all
dismounted


we
scrambled
up
an
almost
perpendicular
place
to
where
there
was
a
little

box


made
of
hurdles
and
interwoven
with
branches
of
fir
and
heather

about
five
feet
in
height

there
we
seated
ourselves
with
bertie

macdonald
lying
in
the
heather
near
us

watching
and
quite
concealed

some
had
gone
round
to
beat

and
others
again
were
at
a
little
distance

we
sat
quite
still

and
sketched
a
little

i
doing
the
landscape
and
some
trees

albert
drawing
macdonald
as
he
lay
there

this
lasted
for
nearly
an
hour

when
albert
fancied
he
heard
a
distant
sound

and

in
a
few
minutes

macdonald
whispered
that
he
saw
stags

and
that
albert
should
wait
and
take
a
steady
aim

we
then
heard
them
coming
past

albert
did
not
look
over
the
box

but
through
it

and
fired
through
the
branches

and
then
again
over
the
box

the
deer
retreated

but
albert
felt
certain
he
had
hit
a
stag

he
ran
up
to
the
keepers

and
at
that
moment
they
called
from
below
that
they
â€œhad
got
him
â€
and
albert
ran
on
to
see

i
waited
for
a
bit

but
soon
scrambled
on
with
bertie
and
macdonaldâ€™s
help

and
albert
joined
me
directly

and
we
all
went
down
and
saw
a
magnificent
stag

â€œa
royal
â€
which
had
dropped

soon
after
albert
had
hit
him

at
one
of
the
menâ€™s
feet

the
sport
was
successful

and
every
one
was
delighted


macdonald
and
the
keepers
in
particular


the
former
saying

â€œthat
it
was
her
majestyâ€™s
coming
out
that
had
brought
the
good
luck
â€
i
was
supposed
to
have
â€œa
lucky
foot
â€
of
which
the
highlanders
â€œthink
a
great
deal
â€
we
walked
down
to
the
place
we
last
came
up

got
into
the
carriage

and
were
home
by
half
past
two

old
john
gordon

his

our
rooms
are
delightfully
papered

the
ceilings
as
well
as
walls

and
very
nicely
furnished

we
lunched
as
soon
as
we
arrived

and
at
three
walked
down

about
twenty
minutesâ€™
walk

to
the
loch
called
â€œmuich
â€
which
some
say
means
â€œdarknessâ€
or
â€œsorrow
â€
here
we
found
a
large
boat

into
which
we
all
got

and
macdonald

duncan

grant

and

going
in
another
boat
with
the
net

they
rowed
up
to
the
head
of
the
loch

to
where
the

muich

runs
down
out
of
the

dhu
loch


which
is
on
the
other
side



24

this
faithful
and
trusty
valet
nursed
his
dear
master
most
devotedly
through
his
sad
illness
in
december

1861

and
is
now
always
with
me
as
my
personal
groom
of
the
chambers
or
valet

i
gave
him
a
house
near
windsor
castle

where
he
resides
when
the
court
are
there

he
is
a
native
of
coburg

his

has
been
for
fifty
years
fã¶rster
at

close
to
coburg

who
was
very
active
and
efficient

he
is
now
a
page


the
scenery
is
beautiful
here

so
wild
and
grand


real
severe
highland
scenery

with
trees
in
the
hollow

we
had
various
scrambles
in
and
out
of
the
boat
and
along
the
shore

and
saw
three
hawks

and
caught
seventy
trout

i
wish
an
artist
could
have
been
there
to
sketch
the
scene

it
was
so
picturesque

the
boat

the
net

and
the
people
in
their
kilts
in
the
water

and
on
the
shore

in
going
back

albert
rowed
and
macdonald
steered

and
the
lights
were
beautiful


we
came
home
at
a
quarter
past
seven

at
eight
we
dined

lã¶hlein

macdonald

and
shackle
waiting
on
us


after
dinner
we
played
with
caroline
dawson
at
whist
with
dummy

and
afterwards
walked
round
the
little
garden

the
silence
and
solitude

only
interrupted
by
the
waving
of
the
fir
trees

were
very
solemn
and
striking





a
beat
in
the
abergeldie
woods






september
3

1849



at
a
quarter
past
eleven
we
drove

the
three
gentlemen
going
in
another
carriage

to
the
road
along
which
we
went
with
lord
portman
the
other
day

and
up
to
a
small
path

where
i
mounted
my
pony

albert
and
the
others
walking

we
came
to

geannachoil


and
albert
was
much
pleased
with
the
splendid
view

the
lights
were
most
beautiful

but
the
heat
was
overpowering

and
the
sun
burning

we
turned
to
the
right
when
out
on
the
moors

where
i
got
off
and
walked

and
we
seated
ourselves
behind
a
large
stone

no
one
but
macdonald
with
us

who
loaded
the
guns

and
gave
notice
when
anything
was
to
be
seen

as
he
lay
upon
the
ground

the
gentlemen
were
below
in
the
road

the
wood
was
beat

but
nothing
came

so
we
walked
on
and
came
down
a
beautiful
thickly
wooded
glen

and
after
a
good
deal
of
scrambling
to
get
there

and
to
get
up
one
side
of
the
glen

we
sat
down
again

we
then
scrambled
over
to
the
opposite
side

where
we
again
concealed
ourselves

in
this
beat
albert
shot
a
roe

and
i
think
would
have
shot
more
had
they
not
been
turned
back
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
an
old
woman
who

looking
like
a
witch

came
along
through
the
wood
with
two
immense
crutches

and
disturbed
the
whole
thing

albert
killed
the
roe
just
as
she
was
coming
along

and
the
shot
startled
her
very
much

she
was
told
to
come
down

which
she
did

and
sat
below
in
the
glen

motionless

having
covered
her
head
with
her
handkerchief

when
two
of
the
beaters
came
down
and
were
told
to
take
up
the
roe

they
first
saw
the
old
woman

and
started

and
stared
with
horror

which
was
very
amusing
to
see

i
rode
a
little
way
afterwards

and
then
we
seated
ourselves
behind
a
bush

in
the
rear
of
the
wood

close
to
the
distillery

but
this
beat
brought
nothing

albert
killed
a
young
black
cock
before
we
came
to
the
second
beat

we
were
home
at
a
quarter
past
three
oâ€™clock





visit
to
the
dhu
loch

september
11

1849



the
morning
was
very
fine

i
heard
the
children
repeat
some
poetry
in
german

and
then
at
ten
oâ€™clock
we
set
off
with
lady
douro
26

in
our
carriage

and
drove
on
beyond

inch
bobbard


changing
horses
near

birkhall


and
stopping
for
a
moment
at
the

linn
of
muich


here
we
found
the
ponies

which
we
mounted

forded
the
river

and
were
almost
immediately
at
the
hut

we
stopped
there
only
for
an
instant

and
remounted
our
ponies
directly

grant

macdonald

who
led
my
pony
the
whole
time

and
was
extremely
useful
and
attentive


jemmie
coutts

leading
lady
douroâ€™s
pony


charlie
coutts

and
john
brown
going
with
us

old
john
gordon
leading
the
way

it
was
half
past
twelve
when
we
began
ascending
the
hill
immediately
behind
the
house

and
proceeded
along
over
the
hills

to
a
great
height

whence
the
view
was
very
fine

quite
overhanging
the
loch

and
commanding
an
extensive
view
of

glen
muich

beyond
on
the
opposite
side

the
road
got
worse
and
worse

it
was
particularly
bad
when
we
had
to
pass
the

burn
of
the
glassalt


which
falls
into
the
loch

and
was
very
full

there
had
been
so
much
rain

that
the
burns
and
rivers
were
very
full

and
the
ground
quite
soft

we
rode
over
the

strone


hill


the
wind
blowing
dreadfully
hard
when
we
came
to
the
top

albert
walked
almost
from
the
first

and
shot
a
hare
and
a
grouse

he
put
up
a
good
many
of
them

we
walked
to
a
little
hollow
immediately
above
the

dhu
loch


and
at
half
past
three
seated
ourselves
there

and
had
some
very
welcome
luncheon

the
loch
is
only
a
mile
in
length

and
very
wild

the
hills

which
are
very
rocky
and
precipitous

rising
perpendicularly
from
it



26

now
duchess
of
wellington


in
about
half
an
hour
we
began
our
journey
homewards

we
came
straight
down
beside
the

muich


which
falls
in
the
most
beautiful
way
over
the
rocks
and
stones
in
the
glen

we
rode
down

and
only
had
to
get
off
to
cross
the

glassalt


which
was
an
awkward
ford
to
scramble
over

the
road
was
rough

but
certainly
far
less
soft
and
disagreeable
than
the
one
we
came
by

i
rode
â€œlochnagarâ€
at
first

but
changed
him
for
colonel
gordonâ€™s
pony

as
i
thought
he
took
fright
at
the
bogs

but
colonel
gordonâ€™s
was
broken
winded

and
struggled
very
much
in
the
soft
ground

which
was
very
disagreeable


we
were
only
an
hour
coming
down
to
the
boat

the
evening
was
very
fine

but
it
blew
very
hard
on
the
lake
and
the
men
could
not
pull

and
i
got
so
alarmed
that
i
begged
to
land

and
lady
douro
was
of
my
opinion
that
it
was
much
better
to
get
out

we
accordingly
landed

and
rode
home
along
a
sort
of
sheep
path
on
the
side
of
the
lake

which
took
us
three
quarters
of
an
hour

it
was
very
rough
and
very
narrow

for
the
hill
rises
abruptly
from
the
lake

we
had
seven
hundred
feet
above
us

and
i
suppose
one
hundred
feet
below

however

we
arrived
at
the
hut
quite
safely
at
twenty
minutes
to
seven

thankful
to
have
got
through
all
our
difficulties
and
adventures

which
are
always
very
pleasant
to
look
back
upon


we
dined
a
little
before
eight
with
lady
douro

and
played
two
rubbers
of
whist
with
her


old
john
gordon
amused
albert
by
saying

in
speaking
of
the
bad
road
we
had
gone

â€œitâ€™s
something
steep
and
something
rough
â€
and
â€œthis
is
the
only
best
â€
meaning
that
it
was

very

bad


which
was
a
characteristic

september
6

1850



at
half
past
ten
oâ€™clock
we
set
off
with
lady
douro
and
ernest
leiningen

27

and
drove
to

invercauld


about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
beyond
the
house

where
we
found
our
people
and
ponies

together
with
arthur
farquharson

shewin

and
others

we
then
walked
a
little
way

after
which
we
mounted
our
ponies
and
began
the
ascent
towards

ben
na
bhourd


macdonald
leading
my
pony

good
little
â€œlochnagar
â€
and
james
coutts
lady
douroâ€™s

there
is
an
excellent
path

almost
a
narrow
road

made
up
to
within
the
last
two
miles
and
a
half

which
are
very
steep
and
rocky

the
scenery
is
beautiful

we
first
rode
up
a
glen

where
a
stone
of
the
house
in
which
finla

the
first
of
the
farquharsons

was
born

is
still
shown


through
which
the

glassalt

runs

further
on
comes
a
very
narrow

rocky

and
precipitous
glen

called
the

sluggan


said
to
mean
the
â€œswallow
â€
or
â€œswallowing
â€
some
little
distance
after
this
the
country
opens
widely
before
you

with

ben
na
bhourd

rising
towards
the
left

and
then
you
enter
the

forest
of
mar


which
the
duke
of
leeds
rents
from
lord
fife

there
is
a
very
pretty
little
shooting
box

called

sluggan
cottage


which
is
half
way
from

invercauld

to
the
top
of

ben
na
bhourd


below
this
is
the

quoich


which
we
forded

the
last
bit
of
the
real
road
is
a
long
steep
ascent
on
the
brow
of
a
hill

the
name
of
which
means
the
â€œtoothâ€™s
craig
â€

macdonald
translated
all
the
names
for
us


the
ascent

after
the
path
ceases

is
very
stony

in
fact

nothing
but
bare
granite

albert
had
walked
a
great
deal

and
we
ladies
got
off
after
it
became
more
uneven

and
when
we
were
no
longer
very
far
from
the
top

we
came
upon
a
number
of
â€œcairngorms
â€
which
we
all
began
picking
up

and
found
some
very
pretty
ones

at
the
top

which
is
perfectly
flat

the

to
have
stopped
just
a
few
feet
below

we
sat
down
at
a
cairn
and
had
our
luncheon

the
wind
was
extremely
cold

but
whenever
we
got
out
of
it

the
air
was
very
hot

the
view
from
the
top
was
magnificent
and
most
extensive

our

after
luncheon
we
began
our
downward
progress

and
walked
the
whole
of
the
steep
part
till
we
reached
the
path

we
came
down
very
quickly

my
pony
making
great
haste

though
he
had
half
a
mind
to
kick

albert
found
some
beautiful
little
rock
crystals
in
the

sluggan


and
walked
the
remainder
of
the
way

we
ladies
left
our
horses
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
we
met
the
carriage

the
whole
distance
from

invercauld

to
the
top
of

ben
na
bhourd

is
nine
miles

so
we
must
have
been
at
least
18
miles
riding
and
walking

it
has
been
a
delightful
expedition

it
was
six
oâ€™clock
when
we
reached
the
carriage

and
we
were
home
at
a
little
past
seven





the
gathering






september
12

1850



we
lunched
early

and
then
went
at
half
past
two
oâ€™clock

with
the
children
and
all
our
party

except
lady
douro

to
the
gathering
at
the

castle
of
braemar


as
we
did
last
year

the
duffs

farquharsons

the
leedsâ€™s

and
those
staying
with
them

and
captain
forbes
28

and
forty
of
his
men
who
had
come
over
from

strath
don


were
there

29

some
of
our
people
were
there
also

there
were
the
usual
games
of
â€œputting
the
stone
â€
â€œthrowing
the
hammerâ€
and
â€œcaber
â€
and
racing
up
the
hill
of

craig
cheunnich


which
was
accomplished
in
less
than
six
minutes
and
a
half

and
we
were
all
much
pleased
to
see
our
gillie
duncan

30

who
is
an
active

good
looking

young
man

win

he
was
far
before
the
others
the
whole
way

it
is
a
fearful
exertion

mr

farquharson
brought
him
up
to
me
afterwards

eighteen
or
nineteen
started

and
it
looked
very
pretty
to
see
them
run
off
in
their
different
coloured
kilts

with
their
white
shirts

the
jackets
or
doublets
they
take
off
for
all
the
games


and
scramble
up
through
the
wood

emerging
gradually
at
the
edge
of
it

and

of

one
of
the
keepers
since
1851

an
excellent

intelligent
man

much
liked
by
the
prince

he

like
many
others

spit
blood
after
running
the
race
up
that
steep
hill
in
this
short
space
of
time

and
he
has
never
been
so
strong
since

the
running
up
hill
has
in
consequence
been
discontinued

he
lives
in
a
cottage
at
the
back
of
craig
gowan

commanding
a
beautiful
view

called
robrech

which
the
prince
built
for
him


after
this
we
went
into
the
castle

and
saw
some
dancing

the
prettiest
was
a
reel
by
mr

farquharsonâ€™s
children
and
some
other
children

and
the
â€œghillie
callumâ€
beautifully
danced
by
john
athole
farquharson

the
fourth
son

the
twelve
children
were
all
there

including
the
baby

who
is
two
years
old


mama

charles

and
ernest
joined
us
at

braemar


mama
enjoys
it
all
very
much

it
is
her
first
visit
to

scotland


we
left
after
the
dancing





salmon
leistering






september
13

1850



we
walked
with
charles

the
boys

and
vicky
to
the
river
side
above
the
bridge

where
all
our
tenants
were
assembled
with
poles
and
spears

or
rather
â€œleistersâ€
for
catching
salmon

they
all
went
into
the
river

walking
up
it

and
then
back
again

poking
about
under
all
the
stones
to
bring
fish
up
to
where
the
men
stood
with
the
net

it
had
a
very
pretty
effect

about
one
hundred
men
wading
through
the
river

some
in
kilts
with
poles
and
spears

all
very
much
excited

not
succeeding
the
first
time

we
went
higher
up

and
moved
to
three
or
four
different
places

but
did
not
get
any
salmon

one
or
two
escaping

albert
stood
on
a
stone

and
colonel
gordon
and
lord
james
murray
waded
about
the
whole
time

duncan

in
spite
of
all
his
exertions
yesterday

and
having
besides
walked
to
and
from
the
gathering

was
the
whole
time
in
the
water

not
far
from
the
laundry
there
was
another
trial

and
here
we
had
a
great
fright

in
one
place
there
was
a
very
deep
pool

into
which
two
men
very
foolishly
went

and
one
could
not
swim

we
suddenly
saw
them
sink

and
in
one
moment
they
seemed
drowning

though
surrounded
by
people

there
was
a
cry
for
help

and
a
general
rush

including
albert

towards
the
spot

which
frightened
me
so
much

that
i
grasped
lord
carlisleâ€™s
arm
in
great
agony

however

dr

robertson
31

swam
in
and
pulled
the
man
out

and
all
was
safely
over

but
it
was
a
horrid
moment



31

the
gentleman
who
has
had
from
the
beginning
the
entire
management
of
our
property
at
balmoral


c

he
is
highly
esteemed

and
is
a
most
amiable
man

who
has
carried
out
all
the
princeâ€™s
and
my
wishes
admirably


a
salmon
was
speared
here
by
one
of
the
men

after
which
we
walked
to
the
ford

or
quarry

where
we
were
very
successful

seven
salmon
being
caught

some
in
the
net

and
some
speared

though
albert
stood
in
the
water
some
time
he
caught
nothing

but
the
scene
at
this
beautiful
spot
was
exciting
and
picturesque
in
the
extreme

i
wished
for
landseerâ€™s
pencil

the
sun
was
intensely
hot

we
did
not
get
back
till
after
three
oâ€™clock

and
then
took
luncheon

the
duchess
of
gordon
came
to
see
us
afterwards

and
while
she
was
still
with
us

captain
forbes

who
had
asked
permission
to
do
so

marched
through
the
grounds
with
his
men

the
pipers
going
in
front

they
stopped

and
cheered
three
times
three

throwing
up
their
bonnets

they
then
marched
off

and
we
listened
with
pleasure
to
the
distant
shouts
and
the
sound
of
the
pibroch


we
heard
afterwards
that
our
men
had
carried
all
captain
forbesâ€™s
men
on
their
backs
through
the
river

they
saw
the
fishing
going
on

and
came
to
the
waterâ€™s
edge
on
the
opposite
side

and
on
being
greeted
by
our
people

said
they
would
come
over

on
which
ours
went
across
in
one
moment
and
carried
them
over

macdonald
at
their
head
carrying
captain
forbes
on
his
back

this
was
very
courteous

and
worthy
of
chivalrous
times

1850



we
reached
the
hut
at
three
oâ€™clock

at
half
past
four
we
walked
down
to
the
loch

into

and
leys
rowing

they
rowed
mostly
towards
the
opposite
side

which
is
very
fine
indeed

and
deeply
furrowed
by
the
torrents

which
form
glens
and
corries
where
birch
and
alder
trees
grow
close
to
the
waterâ€™s
edge

we
landed
on
a
sandy
spot
below
a
fine
glen

through
which
flows
the

black
burn


it
was
very
dry
here

but
still
very
picturesque

with
alder
trees
and
mountain
ash
in
full
fruit
overhanging
it

we
afterwards
landed
at
our
usual
place
at
the
head
of
the
loch

which
is
magnificent

and
rode
back

new
road

excellent
one

who

in
1858

became
my
regular
attendant
out
of
doors
everywhere
in
the
highlands

who
commenced
as
gillie
in
1849

and
was
selected
by
albert
and
me
to
go
with
my
carriage

in
1851
he
entered
our
service
permanently

and
began
in
that
year
leading
my
pony

and
advanced
step
by
step
by
his
good
conduct
and
intelligence

his
attention

care

and
faithfulness
cannot
be
exceeded

the
state
of
my
health

which
of
late
years
has
been
sorely
tried
and
weakened

renders
such
qualifications
most
valuable

and
indeed

most
needful
in
a
constant
attendant
upon
all
occasions

he
has
since

in
december

1865


most
deservedly

been
promoted
to
be
an
upper
servant

and
my
permanent
personal
attendant

he
has
all
the
independence
and
elevated
feelings
peculiar
to
the
highland
race

is
singularly
straightforward

simple
minded

kind
hearted

disinterested

always
ready
to
oblige

is
now
in

fortieth

reflected

with
its

were

at

past

it
was
so
still
and
pretty
as
we

plaid
scarf
over
my
shoulder

and
albert
his
highland
dress
which
he
wears
every
evening

we
drove
in
the
postchaise

the
two
ladies

lord
derby
and
colonel
gordon
following
in
the
other
carriage


it
was
a
mild
though
threatening
evening

but
fortunately
it
kept
fine

we
arrived
there
at
half
past
eight

by
which
time

of
course

it
was
quite
dark

mr

and
lady
agnes
duff
34

received
us
at
the
door

and
then
took
us
at
once
through
the
house
to
the
open
space
where
the
ball
was

which
was
hid
from
our
view
till
the
curtains
were
drawn
asunder

it
was
really
a
beautiful
and
most
unusual
sight

all
the
company
were
assembled
there

a
space
about
one
hundred
feet
in
length
and
sixty
feet
in
width
was
boarded

and
entirely
surrounded
by
highlanders
bearing
torches

which
were
placed
in
sockets

and
constantly
replenished

there
were
seven
pipers
playing
together

mackay
35

leading

and
they
received
us
with
the
usual
salute
and
three
cheers

and
â€œnis

â€

and
again
cheers

after
which
came
a
most
animated
reel

there
were
about
sixty
people

exclusive
of
the
highlanders

of
whom
there
were
also
sixty

all
the
highland
gentlemen

and
any
who
were
at
all
scotch

were
in
kilts

the
ladies
in
evening
dresses

the
company
and
the
highlanders
danced
pretty
nearly
alternately

there
were
two
or
three
sword
dances

we
were
upon
a

haut
pas


over
which
there
was
a
canopy

the
whole
thing
was
admirably
done

and
very
well
worth
seeing

albert
was
delighted
with
it

i
must
not
omit
to
mention
a
reel
danced
by
eight
highlanders
holding
torches
in
their
hands



34

now
earl
and
countess
of

my
piper
from
the
year
1843

considered
almost
the
first
in
scotland

who
was
recommended
by
the
marquis
of
breadalbane

he
unfortunately
went
out
of
his
mind
in
the
year
1854

and
died
in
1855

a
brother
of
his
was
piper
to
the
duke
of
sussex


we
left
at
half
past
nine
oâ€™clock

and
were
home
by
a
little
past
eleven

a
long
way
certainly

14
miles
i
believe






account
of
the
news
of
the
duke
of
wellingtonâ€™s
death






alt

thursday

september
16

1852



we
were
startled
this
morning

at
seven
oâ€™clock

by
a
letter
from
colonel
phipps

enclosing
a
telegraphic
despatch
with
the
report

from
the
sixth
edition
of
the

sun


of
the
duke
of
wellingtonâ€™s
death
the
day
before
yesterday

which
report

however

we
did
not
at
all
believe

would
to
god
that
we
had
been
right

and
that
this
day
had
not
been
cruelly
saddened
in
the
afternoon


we
breakfasted
with
miss
seymour

36

and

after
writing
and
reading

we
started
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
with
her
and
our
highland
party

the
day
was
not
cold

and
would

in
fact

have
been
very
fine

if
it
had
not
been
for
a
constant
succession
of
very
slight
showers

or
clouds
coming
down

we
walked
along
the
loch

the
road
up
to
which
is
excellent

it
has
been
widened
and
would
admit
of
a
carriage

we
arrived
at
the

alt
na
dearg


a
small
burn
and
fall

which
is
very
fine
and
rapid

up
this
a
winding
path
has
been
made

upon
which
we
rode

though
some
parts
are
rather
steep
for
riding

the
burn
falls
over
red
granite

and
in
the
ravine
grow
birch

mountain
ash

and
alder

we
got
off
and
walked
a
good
long
way
on
the
top
of
the
very
steep
hills
overhanging
the
loch

to
the

stron


and
the

moss
of
mon
elpie


whence
you
overlook
all
the
country
belonging
to
lord
panmure


mount
keen


the

ogilvie
hills



c

we
stopped
to
rest
a
little
while

though
the
walking
is
excellent

so
hard
and
dry

on
a
point
overlooking
the

shiel
of
the
glassalt


and
the
head
of
the
loch

here
i
suddenly
missed
my
watch

which
the
dear
old
duke
had
given
me

and

not
being
certain
whether
i
had
put
it
on
or
not

i
asked
mackenzie
37

to
go
back
and
inquire

we
walked
on
until
we
reached
the
higher
part
of
the

glassalt


which
we
stepped
across

we
had
passed
over
the
tops
of
these
hills
on
that
expedition
to
the

dhu
loch

three
years
ago

when
the
ground
was
so
soft

that
ponies
could
scarcely
get
along

the
roads
were
so
very
bad



36

now
hon

lady
biddulph



37

one
of
our
keepers
and
a
very
good
man

he
lives
at
alt
na
giuthasach


then
we
began
the
descent
of
the

glassalt


along
which
another
path
has
been
admirably
made

from
here
it
is
quite
beautiful

so
wild
and
grand

the
falls
are
equal
to
those
of
the

bruar

at

blair


and
are
150
feet
in
height

the
whole
height
to
the
foot
of
the
loch
being
500
feet

it
looked
very
picturesque
to
see
the
ponies
and
highlanders
winding
along

we
came

down
to
the

shiel
of
the
glassalt


lately
built

where
there
is
a
charming
room
for
us

commanding
a
most
lovely
view

here
we
took
the
cold
luncheon

which
we
had
brought
with
us

and
after
that
we
mounted
our
ponies

and
rode
to
the

dhu
loch


along
a
beautiful
path
which
keeps
well
above
the
burn

that
rushes
along
over
flat
great
slabs
of
stone

the
scenery
is
exquisite

we
passed
a
small
fall
called
the

burn
of
the
spullan


â€œspoutâ€


in
half
or
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
were
at
the
wild
and
picturesque

dhu
loch



we
got
off
our
ponies

and
i
had
just
sat
down
to
sketch

when
mackenzie
returned

saying
my
watch
was
safe
at
home

and
bringing
letters

amongst
them
there
was
one
from
lord
derby

which
i
tore
open

and
alas

it
contained
the
confirmation
of
the
fatal
news

that

englandâ€™s


or
rather

britainâ€™s

pride

her
glory

her
hero

the
greatest
man
she
ever
had
produced

was
no
more

sad
day

great
and
irreparable
national
loss


lord
derby
enclosed
a
few
lines
from
lord
charles
wellesley

saying
that
his
dear
great
father
had
died
on
tuesday
at
three
oâ€™clock

after
a
few
hoursâ€™
illness
and
no
suffering

godâ€™s
will
be
done

the
day
must
have
come

the
duke
was
eighty
three

it
is
well
for
him
that
he
has
been
taken
when
still
in
the
possession
of
his
great
mind

and
without
a
long
illness


but
what
a

loss


one
cannot
think
of
this
country
without
â€œthe
duke
â€

our
immortal
hero


in
him
centered
almost
every
earthly
honour
a
subject
could
possess

his
position
was
the
highest
a
subject
ever
had


above
party


looked
up
to
by
all


revered
by
the
whole
nation


the
friend
of
the
sovereign


and

how

simply
he
carried
these
honours

with
what
singleness
of
purpose

what
straightforwardness

what
courage

were
all
the
motives
of
his
actions
guided

the
crown
never
possessed


and
i
fear
never

will


so

devoted


loyal

and
faithful
a
subject

so
staunch
a
supporter

to

us


who
alas

have
lost

now

so
many
of
our
valued
and
experienced
friends


his
loss
is

irreparable


for
his
readiness
to
aid
and
advise

if
it
could
be
of
use
to
us

and
to
overcome
any
and
every
difficulty

was
unequalled

to
albert
he
showed
the
greatest
kindness
and
the
utmost
confidence

his
experience
and
his
knowledge
of
the
past
were
so
great
too

he
was
a
link
which
connected
us
with
bygone
times

with
the
last
century

not
an
eye
will
be
dry
in
the
whole
country


we
hastened
down
on
foot
to
the
head
of

loch
muich


and
then
rode
home

in
a
heavy
shower

to

alt
na
giuthasach


our
whole
enjoyment
was
spoilt

a
gloom
overhung
all
of
us


we
wrote
to
lord

1852



this
day
has
been
a
very
happy

lucky

and
memorable
one

our
last

a
fine
morning


albert
had
to
see
mr

walpole

and
therefore
it
was
nearly
eleven
oâ€™clock
before
we
could
go
up
to
the
top
of

craig
gowan


to
see
the
cairn
built

which
was
to
commemorate
our
taking
possession
of
this
dear
place

the
old
cairn
having
been
pulled
down

we
set
off
with
all
the
children

ladies

gentlemen

and
a
few
of
the
servants

including
macdonald
and
grant

who
had
not
already
gone
up

and
at
the

moss
house


which
is
half
way

mackay
met
us

and
preceded
us

playing

duncan
and
donald
stewart
38

going
before
him

to
the
highest
point
of

craig
gowan


where
were
assembled
all
the
servants
and
tenants

with
their
wives
and
children
and
old
relations

all
our
little
friends
were
there

mary
symons
and
lizzie
stewart

the
four
grants

and
several
others



38

one
of
the
keepers

whom
we
found
here
in
1848

he
is
an
excellent
man

and
was
much
liked
by
the
prince

he
always
led
the
dogs
when
the
prince
went
out
stalking

he
lives
in
the
western
lodge

close
to
grantâ€™s
house

which
was
built
for
him
by
the
prince


i
then
placed
the
first
stone

after
which
albert
laid
one

then
the
children

according
to
their
ages

all
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
placed
one

and
then
every
one
came
forward
at
once

each
person
carrying
a
stone
and
placing
it
on
the
cairn

mr

and
mrs

anderson
were
there

mackay
played

and
whisky
was
given
to
all

it
took

i
am
sure

an
hour
building

and
whilst
it
was
going
on

some
merry
reels
were
danced
on
a
stone
opposite

all
the
old
people

even
the
gardenerâ€™s
wife
from

corbie
hall


near

abergeldie



danced

and
many
of
the
children

mary
symons
and
lizzie
stewart
especially

danced
so
nicely

the
latter
with
her
hair
all
hanging
down

poor
dear
old
â€œmonk
â€
sir
robert
gordonâ€™s
faithful
old
dog

was
sitting
there
amongst
us
all

at
last

when
the
cairn

which
is

i
think

seven
or
eight
feet
high

was
nearly
completed

albert
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
it

and
placed
the
last
stone

after
which
three
cheers
were
given

it
was
a
gay

pretty

and
touching
sight

and
i
felt
almost
inclined
to
cry

the
view
was
so
beautiful
over
the
dear
hills

the
day
so
fine

the
whole
so

gemã¼thlich


may
god
bless
this
place

and
allow
us
yet
to
see
it
and
enjoy
it
many
a
long
year



illustration


after
luncheon

albert
decided
to
walk
through
the
wood
for
the
last
time

to
have
a
last
chance

and
allowed
vicky
and
me
to
go
with
him

at
half
past
three
oâ€™clock
we
started

got
out
at
grantâ€™s

and
walked
up
part
of

carrop


intending
to
go
along
the
upper
path

when
a
stag
was
heard
to
roar

and
we
all
turned
into
the
wood

we
crept
along

and
got
into
the
middle
path

albert
soon
left
us
to
go
lower

and
we
sat
down
to
wait
for
him

presently
we
heard
a
shot

then
complete
silence

and

after
another
pause
of
some
little
time

three
more
shots

this
was
again
succeeded
by
complete
silence

we
sent
some
one
to
look

who
shortly
after
returned

saying
the
stag
had
been
twice
hit
and
they
were
after
him

macdonald
next
went

and
in
about
five
minutes
we
heard
â€œsolomonâ€
give
tongue

and
knew
he
had
the
stag
at
bay

we
listened
a
little
while

and
then
began
moving
down
hoping
to
arrive
in
time

but
the
barking
had
ceased

and
albert
had
already
killed
the
stag

and
on
the
road
he
lay

a
little
way
beyond

invergelder


the
beauty
that
we
had
admired
yesterday
evening

he
was
a
magnificent
animal

and
i
sat
down
and
scratched
a
little
sketch
of
him
on
a
bit
of
paper
that
macdonald
had
in
his
pocket

which
i
put
on
a
stone

while
albert
and
vicky

with
the
others

built
a
little
cairn
to
mark
the
spot

we
heard

after
i
had
finished
my
little
scrawl

and
the
carriage
had
joined
us

that
another
stag
had
been
seen
near
the
road

and
we
had
not
gone
as
far
as
the
â€œirons
â€
39

before
we
saw
one
below
the
road

looking
so
handsome

albert
jumped
out
and
fired

the
animal
fell

but
rose
again

and
went
on
a
little
way

and
albert
followed

very
shortly
after

however

we
heard
a
cry

and
ran
down
and
found
grant
and
donald
stewart
pulling
up
a
stag
with
a
very
pretty
head

albert
had
gone
on

grant
went
after
him

and
i
and
vicky
remained
with
donald
stewart

the
stag

and
the
dogs

i
sat
down
to
sketch

and
poor
vicky

unfortunately

seated
herself
on
a
waspâ€™s
nest

and
was
much
stung

donald
stewart
rescued
her

for
i
could
not

being
myself
too
much
alarmed

albert
joined
us
in
twenty
minutes

unaware
of
having
killed
the
stag

what
a
delightful
day

but
sad
that
it
should
be
the
last
day

home
by
half
past
six

we
found
our
beautiful
stag
had
arrived

and
admired
him
much



39

these
â€œironsâ€
are
the
levers
of
an
old
saw
mill
which
was
pulled
down

and
they
were
left
there
to
be
sold

between
thirty
and
forty
years
ago

and
have
remained
there
ever
since

not
being
considered
worth
selling

on
account
of
the
immense
trouble
of
transporting
them

a
fine
morning
early

but
when
we
walked
out
at
half
past
ten
oâ€™clock
it
began
raining

and
soon
poured
down
without
ceasing

most
fortunately
it
cleared
up
before
two

and
the
sun
shone
brightly
for
the
ceremony
of
laying
the
foundation
stone
of
the
new

the

was
strictly

oâ€™clock

when
a
dance

we
walked
round
to
the
spot

preceded
by
mackay

mr

anderson
40

made
a
very
appropriate
prayer

the
wind
was
very
high

but
else
everything
went
off
as
well
as
could
possibly
be
desired

died
november

1866


the
workmen
and
people
all
gave
a
cheer
when
the
whole
was
concluded

in
about
three
quarters
of
an
hourâ€™s
time
we
went
in
to
see
the
people
at
their
dinner

and
after
this
walked
over
to

craig
gowan

for
albert
to
get
a
chance
for
black
game


we
dressed
early

and
went
for
twenty
minutes
before
dinner
to
see
the
people
dancing
in
the
ball
room

which
they
did
with
the
greatest
spirit





the
kirk






october
29

1854



we
went
to
kirk

as
usual

at
twelve
oâ€™clock

the
service
was
performed
by
the
rev

norman
mcleod

of

glasgow


son
of
dr

mcleod

and
anything
finer
i
never
heard

the
sermon

entirely
extempore

was
quite
admirable

so
simple

and
yet
so
eloquent

and
so
beautifully
argued
and
put

the
text
was
from
the
account
of
the
coming
of
nicodemus
to
christ
by
night

st

john

chapter
3

mr

mcleod
showed
in
the
sermon
how
we

all

tried
to
please

self


and
live
for

that


and
in
so
doing
found
no
rest

christ
had
come
not
only
to
die
for
us

but
to
show
how
we
were
to
live

the
second
prayer
was
very
touching

his
allusions
to
us
were
so
simple

saying

after
his
mention
of
us

â€œbless
their
children
â€
it
gave
me
a
lump
in
my
throat

as
also
when
he
prayed
for
â€œthe
dying

the
wounded

the
widow

and
the
orphans
â€
every
one
came
back
delighted

and
how
satisfactory
it
is
to
come
back
from
church
with
such
feelings

the
servants
and
the
highlanders


all


were
equally
delighted





arrival
at
the
new
castle
at
balmoral






september
7

1855



at
a
quarter
past
seven
oâ€™clock
we
arrived
at
dear

balmoral


strange

very
strange

it
seemed
to
me
to
drive
past

indeed

through


the
old
house

the
connecting
part
between
it
and
the
offices
being
broken
through

the
new
house
looks
beautiful

the
tower
and
the
rooms
in
the
connecting
part
are

however

only
half
finished

and
the
offices
are
still
unbuilt

therefore
the
gentlemen

except
the
minister
41


live
in
the
old
house

and
so
do
most
of
the
servants

there
is
a
long
wooden
passage
which
connects
the
new
house
with
the
offices

an
old
shoe
was
thrown
after
us
into
the
house

for
good
luck

when
we
entered
the
hall

the
house
is
charming

the
rooms
delightful

the
furniture

everything

never

quite
beautiful

we
walked
about

and
alongside
the
river

and
looked
at
all
that
has
been
done

and
considered
all
that
has
to
be
done

and
afterwards
we
went
over
to
the
poor
dear
old
house

and
to
our
rooms

which
it
was
quite
melancholy
to
see
so
deserted

and
settled
about
things
being
brought
over





news
of

fall

mama

and
her
lady
and
gentleman

to
dinner


all
were
in
constant
expectation
of
more
telegraphic
despatches

at
half
past
ten
oâ€™clock
two
arrived

one
for
me

and
one
for
lord
granville

i
began
reading
mine

which
was
from
lord
clarendon

with
details
from
marshal
pã©lissier
of
the
further
destruction
of
the
russian
ships

and
lord
granville
said

â€œi
have
still
better
news
â€
on
which
he
read

â€œfrom
general
simpson


sevastopol
is
in
the
hands
of
the
allies

â€
god
be
praised
for
it

our
delight
was
great

but
we
could
hardly
believe
the
good
news

and
from
having
so
long

so
anxiously
expected
it

one
could
not
realize
the
actual
fact


albert
said
they
should
go
at
once
and
light
the
bonfire
which
had
been
prepared
when
the
false
report
of
the
fall
of
the
town
arrived
last
year

and
had
remained
ever
since

waiting
to
be
lit

on
the
5th
of
november

the
day
of
the
battle
of

inkermann


the
wind
upset
it

strange
to
say

and
now
again

most
strangely

it
only
seemed
to

wait

for
our
return
to
be
lit


the
new
house
seems
to
be
lucky

indeed

for

from
the
first
moment
of
our
arrival

we
have
had
good
news

in
a
few
minutes

albert
and
all
the
gentlemen

in
every
species
of
attire

sallied
forth

followed
by
all
the
servants

and
gradually
by
all
the
population
of
the
village

keepers

gillies

workmen

up
to
the
top
of
the
cairn

we
waited

and
saw
them
light
the
bonfire

accompanied
by
general
cheering

it
blazed
forth
brilliantly

and
we
could
see
the
numerous
figures
surrounding
it

some
dancing

all
shouting


ross
42

playing
his
pipes

and
grant
and
macdonald
firing
off
guns
continually

while
poor
old
franã§ois
dâ€™albertanã§on
43

lighted
a
number
of
squibs
below

the
greater
part
of
which
would
not
go
off

about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
after

albert
came
down

and
said
the
scene
had
been
wild
and
exciting
beyond
everything

the
people
had
been
drinking
healths
in
whisky

and
were
in
great
ecstasy

the
whole
house
seemed
in
a
wonderful
state
of
excitement

the
boys
were
with
difficulty
awakened

and
when
at
last
this
was
the
case

they
begged
leave
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
cairn



42

my
piper
since
1854

he
had
served
seventeen
years
in
the
42nd
highlanders

a
very
respectable

good
man



43

an
old
servant
of
sir
r

gordonâ€™s

who
had
charge
of
the
house

and
was
a
native
of
alsace

he
died
in
1858


we
remained
till
a
quarter
to
twelve

and

just
as
i
was
undressing

all
the
people
came
down
under
the
windows

the
pipes
playing

the
people
singing

firing
off
guns

and
cheering

first
for
me

then
for
albert

the
emperor
of
the
french

and
the
â€œdownfall
of

â€




the
betrothal
of
the
princess
royal






september
29

1855



our
dear
victoria
was
this
day
engaged
to
prince
frederick
william
of
prussia

who
had
been
on
a
visit
to
us
since
the
14th

he
had
already
spoken
to
us

on
the
20th

of
his
wishes

but
we
were
uncertain

on
account
of
her
extreme
youth

whether
he
should
speak
to
her
himself

or
wait
till
he
came
back
again

however

we
felt
it
was
better
he
should
do
so

and
during
our
ride
up

craig
na
ban

this
afternoon

he
picked
a
piece
of
white
heather


the
emblem
of
â€œgood
luck
â€

which
he
gave
to
her

and
this
enabled
him
to
make
an
allusion
to
his
hopes
and
wishes

as
they
rode
down

glen
girnoch


which
led
to
this
happy
conclusion





the
kirk






october
14

1855



to
kirk
at
twelve
oâ€™clock

the
rev

j

caird

one
of
the
most
celebrated
preachers
in

scotland


performed
the
service

and
electrified
all
present
by
a
most
admirable
and
beautiful
sermon

which
lasted
nearly
an
hour

but
which
kept
oneâ€™s
attention
riveted

the
text
was
from
the
twelfth
chapter
of
romans

and
the
eleventh
verse

â€œ
not
slothful
in
business

fervent
in
spirit

serving
the
lord

â€
he
explained

in
the
most
beautiful
and
simple
manner

what
real
religion
is

how
it
ought
to
pervade
every
action
of
our
lives

not
a
thing
only
for
sundays

or
for
our
closet

not
a
thing
to
drive
us
from
the
world

not
â€œa
perpetual
moping
over
â€˜goodâ€™
books
â€
but
â€œbeing
and
doing
good
â€
â€œletting
everything
be
done
in
a
christian
spirit
â€
it
was
as
fine
as
mr

mcleodâ€™s
sermon
last
year

and
sent
us
home
much
edified





finding
the
old
castle
gone






august
30

1856



on
arriving
at

balmoral

at
seven
oâ€™clock
in
the
evening

we
found
the
tower
finished
as
well
as
the
offices

and
the
poor
old
house
gone

the
effect
of
the
whole
is
very
fine

round
the
new
castle






august
31

we
walked
along
the
river
and
outside
the
house

the
new
offices
and
the
yard
are
excellent

and
the
little
garden
on
the
west
side

with
the
eagle
fountain
which
the
king
of
prussia
gave
me

and
which
used
to
be
in
the
greenhouse
at

windsor


is
extremely
pretty

as
are
also
the
flower
beds
under
the
walls
of
the
side
which
faces
the

dee


there
are
sculptured
arms
on
the
different
shields

gilt

which
has
a
very
good
effect

and
a

relief
under
our
windows

not

representing
st

for
the
day

and
i
walked
out
with
the

stopped
at
the

and
made
some

and
walked
up
the
hill
to

balnacroft


mrs

p

farquharsonâ€™s

and
she
walked
round
with
us
to
some
of
the
cottages
to
show
me
where
the
poor
people
lived

and
to
tell
them
who
i
was

before
we
went
into

very
poor

eighty

years
old

and
mother
to
the
former
distiller

i
gave
her
a
warm
petticoat

and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
old
cheeks

and
she
shook
my
hands

and
prayed
god
to
bless
me

it
was
very
touching


i
went
into
a
small
cabin
of
old
kitty
kearâ€™s

who
is
eighty
six
years
old

quite
erect

and
who
welcomed
us
with
a
great
air
of
dignity

she
sat
down
and
spun

i
gave
her

also

a
warm
petticoat

she
said

â€œmay
the
lord
ever
attend
ye
and
yours

here
and
hereafter

and
may
the
lord
be
a
guide
to
ye

and
keep
ye
from
all
harm
â€
she
was
quite
surprised
at
vickyâ€™s
height

great
interest
is
taken
in
her

we
went
on
to
a
cottage

formerly
jean
gordonâ€™s


to
visit
old
widow
symons

who
is
â€œpast
fourscore
â€
with
a
nice
rosy
face

but
was
bent
quite
double

she
was
most
friendly

shaking
hands
with
us
all

asking
which
was
i

and
repeating
many
kind
blessings

â€œmay
the
lord
attend
ye
with
mirth
and
with
joy

may
he
ever
be
with
ye
in
this
world

and
when
ye
leave
it
â€
to
vicky

when
told
she
was
going
to
be
married

she
said

â€œmay
the
lord
be
a
guide
to
ye
in
your
future

and
may
every
happiness
attend
ye
â€
she
was
very
talkative

and
when
i
said
i
hoped
to
see
her
again

she
expressed
an
expectation
that
â€œshe
should
be
called
any
day
â€
and
so
did
kitty
kear

45



45

she
died
in
jan

1865


we
went
into
three
other
cottages

to
mrs

symonsâ€™s

daughter
in
law
to
the
old
widow
living
next
door


who
had
an
â€œunwell
boy
â€
then
across
a
little
burn
to
another
old
womanâ€™s

and
afterwards
peeped
into
blair
the
fiddlerâ€™s

we
drove
back

and
got
out
again
to
visit
old
mrs

grant

grantâ€™s
mother


who
is
so
tidy
and
clean

and
to
whom
i
gave
a
dress
and
handkerchief

and
she
said

â€œyouâ€™re
too
kind
to
me

youâ€™re
over
kind
to
me

ye
give
me
more
every
year

and
i
get
older
every
year
â€
after
talking
some
time
with
her

she
said

â€œi
am
happy
to
see
ye
looking
so
nice
â€
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes

and
speaking
of
vickyâ€™s
going

said

â€œiâ€™m
very
sorry

and
i
think
she
is
sorry
herselâ€™
â€
and

having
said
she
feared
she
would
not
see
her

the
princess

again

said

â€œi
am
very
sorry
i
said
that

but
i
meant
no
harm

i
always
say
just
what
i
think

not
what
is
futâ€

fit


dear
old
lady

she
is
such
a
pleasant
person


really
the
affection
of
these
good
people

who
are
so
hearty
and
so
happy
to
see
you

taking
interest
in
everything

is
very
touching
and
gratifying

through

feithluie

to
the
foot
of
the
very
steep
ascent
to

feithort


where
we
got
off
and
walked
up

and
suddenly

when
nearly
at
the
top
of
the
path

came
upon
albertâ€™s
little
encampment

which
was
just
at
the
edge
of
the
winding
path

and
some
of

house

with
shelves
for
keeping
a
few
boxes

no
seat


and
a
little
stove

was
not
at
all
uncomfortable

but
the
wind
was
dreadfully
high

and
blew
in

we
waited
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour

and
then
albert
arrived

he
had
been
out
since
six
oâ€™clock

three
stags

been
bitterly
cold
and
windy

but
he
had
slept

we
lunched
in
the
little
â€œhousieâ€
at
the
open
door

there
was
a
second
hut
for
the
people

luncheon
over

we
walked
down
and
across
the
greater
part
of
the

balloch
buie


mounting
our
ponies
wherever
it
was
wet

we
saw
deer
as
we
came
lower
down

and
all
of
a
sudden
a
stag
was
seen
quite
close
by
the
path

albert
shot
him

and
he
fell
at
once

he
had
very
fine
horns

a
royal
on
one
side


then
they
beat
up
to
the

craig
daign


poor
albert
was
much
tired

and
had
to
walk
all
the
time

as
he
had
no
pony

we
rode
part
of
the
way

then
the
lower
part
of
the
road
was
driven

as
we
were
sitting
by
a
tree
close
to
albert
a
stag
came
out

and
albert
killed
him
at
one
shot

a
fine
day

though
at
times
it
has
been
very
cold

we
got
home
at
half
past
six





a
fall
of
snow






september
18

1858



alas

the
last
day

when
we
got
up
the
weather
seemed
very
hopeless

everything
was
white
with
snow

which
lay

at
least

an
inch
on
the
ground

and
it
continued
snowing
heavily

as
it
had
done
since
five
this
morning

i
wished
we
might
be
snowed
up

and
unable
to
move

how
happy
i
should
have
been
could
it
have
been
so

it
continued
snowing
till
half
past
ten
or
eleven

and
then
it
began
to
clear
up

the
hills
appeared
quite
white

the
sun
came
out

and
it
became
splendidly
bright

albert
was
going
to
have
the
woods
driven

which
are
not
properly
called

carrop
woods


but

garmaddie
woods


but
had
first
to
ride
round

craig
gowan

with
dr

robertson
to
see

robrech


the
place
where
duncanâ€™s
new
house
is
to
be
built

which
is
above
the
village

opposite

craig
luraghain


with
a
most
splendid
view

and
at
grantâ€™s
house
i
was
to
meet
him


at
one
oâ€™clock
i
left
with
alice
and
lenchen
46

for
grantâ€™s

where
we
met
albert

who
joined
us
in
the
carriage

the
day
was
truly
splendid

we
got
out
at
the
river

and
were
going
down
to

nellyâ€™s
bush


when
a
stag
was
heard
roaring
very
near

so
we
had
to
stop

and

with
our
plaids
and
cloaks
to
sit
upon

really
avoided
getting
very
wet

we
waited
till
albert
was
near
to
the
stag

saw
it
move

heard
albert
fire
twice

and
the
stag
turn

stop

and
then
disappear

albert
fired
again

but
the
stag
had
crossed
the

dee


so
we
turned
up
on
to
the
road

and
went
into
the
dear
old

corrie
buie


albert
turning
off
to
see
if
there
were
any
deer
near

while
we
waited
for
him

we
then
came
to
a
place
which
is
always
wet

but
which
was
particularly
bad
after
the
late
rain
and
snow

there
was
no
pony
for
me
to
get
on

and
as
i
wished
not
to
get
my
feet
wet
by
walking
through
the
long
grass

albert
proposed
i
should
be
carried
over
in
a
plaid

and
lenchen
was
first
carried
over

but
it
was
held
too
low

and
her
feet
dangled

so
albert
suggested
the
plaid
should
be
put
round
the
menâ€™s
shoulders

and
that
i
should
sit
upon
it

brown
and
duncan

the
two
strongest
and
handiest

were
the
two
who
undertook
it

and
i
sat
safely
enough
with
an
arm
on
each
manâ€™s
shoulder

and
was
carried
successfully
over

all
the
highlanders
are
so
amusing

and
really
pleasant
and
instructive
to
talk
to

women
as
well
as
men

and
the
latter
so
gentlemanlike

47

albertâ€™s
shots
were
heard
close
by
whilst
we
were
at
luncheon

and
there
was
a
general
rush
of
all
the
people

albert
joined
us
soon
after

he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
stalking
his
stag

which
he
had
been
after
several
days

but
had
killed
him
at
one
shot

he
was
brought
for
us
to
see

a
very
light
coloured
one

with
fine
straight
horns

of
extraordinary
thickness

after
this
we
walked
on
for
a
beat
quite
round

carrop


and
the
view
was
glorious

a
little
shower
of
snow
had
fallen

but
was
succeeded
by
brilliant
sunshine

the
hills
covered
with
snow

the
golden
birch
trees
on
the
lower
brown
hills

and
the
bright
afternoon
sky

were
indescribably
beautiful

a
similar
view
to
that
given
in
the
text
is
admirably
expressed
by
the
reverend
frederick
w

robertson
in
his

lectures
on
literary
and
social
topics


and
his
description
of
a
tyrolese
is
even
more
applicable
to
a
highlander



â€œmy
companion
was
a
tyrolese
chamois
hunter

a
man
who

in
point
of

social
position

might
rank
with
an
english
labourer

i
fear
there

would
be
a
difficulty
in
england
in
making
such
a
companionship

pleasurable
and
easy
to
both
parties

there
would
be
a
painful

obsequiousness

or
else
an
insolent
familiarity
on
the
one
side


constraint
on
the
other

in
this
case
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort


we
walked
together

and
ate
together

he
had
all
the
independence
of
a

man

but
he
knew
the
courtesy
which
was
due
to
a
stranger

and
when
we

parted
for
the
night

he
took
his
leave
with
a
politeness
and
dignity

which
would
have
done
no
discredit
to
the
most
finished
gentleman

the

reason

as
it
seemed
to
me

was
that
his
character
had
been
moulded

by
the
sublimities
of
the
forms
of
the
outward
nature
amidst
which

he
lived

it
was
impossible
to
see
the
clouds
wreathing
themselves

in
that
strange
wild
way
of
theirs
round
the
mountain
crests

till

the
hills
seemed
to
become
awful
things

instinct
with
life

it

was
impossible
to
walk

as
we
did
sometimes

an
hour
or
two
before

sunrise

and
see
the
morningâ€™s
beams
gilding
with
their
pure
light
the

grand
old
peaks
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley

while
we
ourselves

were
still
in
deepest
shade

and
look
on
that
man

his
very
exterior

in
harmony
with
all
around
him

and
his
calm
eye
resting
on
all
that

wondrous
spectacle

without
a
feeling
that
these
things
had
had
their

part
in
making
him
what
he
was

and
that
you
were
in
a
country
in

which
men
were
bound
to
be
polished

bound
to
be
more
refined

almost

bound
to
be
better
men
than
elsewhere

a
sad
heart

from
its
being
for

in

for
this
effect
with
the

we
shall
not
often
see
again

we
saw
it
like
this
in
1852

but
we
have
not
seen
it
so
since

though
we
have
often
had

i
felt
very
low
spirited
at
my
dearest
albert
having
to
leave
at
one
oâ€™clock
for

aberdeen


to
preside
at
the
meeting
of
the

association


i
with
alice

the
two
ladies

lord
charles
fitzroy

and
brown

left
shortly
before
for

morven


we
took
post
horses
at
the
foot
of

gairn


and
drove
by
the
right
side
of
the
glen

along
a
new
good
road

avoiding
the
ford

and
by
half
past
two
we
were
at
the
foot
of

morven


not
far
from
the
shooting
lodge
there

here
we
mounted
our
ponies

and
our
caravan
started
with
the
gillies

jemmie
coutts

an
old
acquaintance

now
keeper
of
the
lodge

leading
the
way

about
half
way

at
a
burn
side

we
stopped

seated
ourselves
on
plaids
on
the
fine
springy
turf

and
took
luncheon

then
walked
about

sketched

mounted
our
ponies

and
rode
up
to
the
top

which
was
rather
steep
and
soft
â€”â€œfoggy
â€
as
brown
called
it

which
is
the
highland
expression
for
mossy

little
pony

being
so
fat

panted
dreadfully


morven

is
2
700
feet
high

and
the
view
from
it
more
magnificent
than
can
be
described

so
large
and
yet
so
near
everything
seemed

and
such
seas
of
mountains
with
blue
lights

and
the
colour
so
wonderfully
beautiful

we
looked
down
upon
the
duke
of
richmondâ€™s
property

and
saw
the
mountain
called
the

buck
of
cabrach


and
still
further
on
the

slate
hills


to
the
east


aberdeen

and
the
blue
sea

even

the
ships

the
naked
eye

the
table

in

we
walked
down
to
where
we
had
lunched

and
rode
to
the
bottom

here
we
found
a

september
22

1859



the
morning
dawned
brightly

suddenly
a
very
high
wind
arose
which
alarmed
us

but
yet
it
looked
bright

and
we
hoped
the
wind
would
keep
off
the
rain

but
after
breakfast

while
watching
the
preparations

showers
began

and
from
half
past
eleven
a
fearful
down
pour

with
that
white
curtain
like
appearance
which
is
so
alarming

and
this
lasted
till
half
past
twelve

i
was
in
despair

but
at
length
it
began
to
clear

just
as
the
neighbours
with
their
families

and
some
of
the
farmers
opposite

the
herrons

duncans

brownâ€™s
father
and
brothers

arrived

and
then
came
the
huge
omnibuses
and
carriages
laden
with
â€œphilosophers
â€
at
two
oâ€™clock
we
were
all
ready

albert
and
the
boys
were
in
their
kilts

and
i
and
the
girls
in
royal
stuart
skirts
and
shawls
over
black
velvet
bodies


it
was
a
beautiful
sight
in
spite
of
the
frequent
slight
showers
which
at
first
tormented
us

and
the
very
high
cold
wind

there
were
gleams
of
sunshine

which

with
the
highlanders
in
their
brilliant
and
picturesque
dresses

the
wild
notes
of
the
pipes

the
band

and
the
beautiful
background
of
mountains
rendered
the
scene
wild
and
striking
in
the
extreme

the
farquharsonâ€™s
men
headed
by
colonel
farquharson

the
duffâ€™s
by
lord
fife

and
the
forbesâ€™s
men
by
sir
charles
forbes

had
all
marched
on
the
ground
before
we
came
out

and
were
drawn
up
just
opposite
to
us

and
the
spectators

the
people
of
the
country

behind
them

we
stood
on
the
terrace

the
company
near
us

and
the
â€œsavants
â€
also

on
either
side
of
us

and
along
the
slopes

on
the
grounds

the
games
began
about
three
oâ€™clock




1



â€œthrowing
the
hammer
â€


2



â€œtossing
the
caber
â€


3



â€œputting
the
stone
â€

we
gave
prizes
to
the
three
best
in
each
of
the
games

we
walked
along
the
terrace
to
the
large
marquee

talking
to
the
people

to
where
the
men
were
â€œputting
the
stone
â€
after
this
returned
to
the
upper
terrace

to
see
the
race

a
pretty
wild
sight

but
the
men
looked
very
cold

with
nothing
but
their
shirts
and
kilts
on

they
ran
beautifully

they
wrapped
plaids
round
themselves

and
then
came
to
receive
the
prizes
from
me

last
of
all
came
the
dancing

reels
and
â€œghillie
callum
â€
the
latter
the
judges
could
not
make
up
their
minds
about

it
was
danced
over
and
over
again

and
at
last
they
left
out
the
best
dancer
of
all

they
said
he
danced
â€œtoo
well
â€
the
dancing
over

we
left
amid
the
loud
cheers
of
the
people

it
was
then
about
half
past
five

we
watched
from
the
window
the
highlanders
marching
away

the
different
people
walking
off

and
four
weighty
omnibuses
filling
with
the
scientific
men

we
saw

and
talked
to

professor
owen

sir
david
brewster

sir

bowring

mr

during
the
fãªte

we
heard
from
sir
r

murchison
and
others
that
news
had
been
received
this
morning
of
the
finding
of
poor
sir
john
franklinâ€™s
remains

or

rather

of
the
things
belonging
to
him
and
his
party


when
almost
all
were
gone

we
took
a
short
walk
to
warm
ourselves

much
pleased
at
everything
having
gone
off
well

all
of
whom
slept

were
additions
to
the
dinner
party

i
sat
between
our
cousin
philip

count
of
flanders

and
the
duke
of
richmond

all
the
gentlemen
spoke
in
very
high
terms
of
my
beloved
albertâ€™s
admirable
speech

the
good
it
had
done

and
the
general
satisfaction
it
had
caused


we
could
see
the
fire
of
the
forbesâ€™s
encampment
on

september
30

1859



at
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
we
started
with
helena
and
louise
in
the
sociable

grant
on
the
box

for

loch
bulig


passing
the
farms
of

blairglass

and
of

dall
dounie


and
the
shooting
lodge
of

corndavon


ten
miles
distant

here
we
found
our
ponies

mine
being
â€œvictoriaâ€


and
rode
along
the
edge
of
the
lake

up
a
beautiful
glen
by
a
path
winding
through
the
valley

which
appeared
frequently
closed

we
then
rode
along
a
small
river
or
burn

of
which
no
one
knew
the
name

none
of
our
party
having
ever
been
there
before

the
hills
were
sprinkled
with
birch
trees

and
there
was
grass
below
in
the
valley

we
saw
deer

as
we
approached

inchrory


a
shooting
lodge
of
lord
h

bentinckâ€™s

the
scenery
became
finer
and
finer

reminding
us
of

glen
tilt


and
was
most
beautiful
at

inchrory


with
the
fine
broad
water
of
the

avon

flowing
down
from
the
mountains


we
inquired
of
the
people
at

inchrory

whether
there
was
any
way
of
getting
round
over
the
hills
by

gairn
shiel


and
they
said
there
was

but
that
the
distance
was
about
11
miles

neither
grant
nor
brown
had
been
that
way

however
we
accepted
it
at
once

and
i
was
delighted
to
go
on

ã 
lâ€™improviste


travelling
about
in
these
enchanting
hills
in
this
solitude

with
only
our
good
highlanders
with
us

who
never
make
difficulties

but
are
cheerful

and
happy

and
merry

and
ready
to
walk

and
run

and
do
anything

so
on
we
went

turning
up
above

inchrory

by
a
winding
road
between
hillocks
and
commanding
a
glorious
view
towards

laganaul


here

on
a
little
grassy
knoll

we
lunched
in
a
splendid
position


after
our
luncheon

and
walking
a
little
way

we
remounted

and
proceeded
by
the
so
called
â€œbrown
cowâ€

on
the
other
side
of
which
we
had
driven


over
a
moor

meeting
a
shepherd

out
of
whom
grant
could
get
little
information

soon
we
came
to
corn
fields
in
the
valley

passed

favanchã©

and

inchmore


and
got
on
to
a
good
road

on
which
brown
and
grant
â€œtravelledâ€
at
a

wonderful

pace

upwards
of
five
miles
an
hour
without
stopping

and
the
former
with
that
vigorous

light

elastic
tread
which
is
quite
astonishing

we
passed

dal
na
damph
shiel


a
shooting
lodge
of
sir
charles
forbes


and
went
along
the
old
â€œmilitary
road
â€
leaving

cockbridge


a
small
straggling
â€œtoun
â€
which
is
on
the
road
to

inverness


to
our
left

and
the
old

castle
of
corgarf

to
our
right

we
looked
over
into

donside


the
road
was
soon
left
for
a
mountain
one
in
the
hills

above
one
of
the
tributary
streams
of
the

don


and
was
wild
and
desolate

we
passed

dal
choupar

and

dal
vown


and

as
we
ascended

we
saw

tornahoish


at
a
distance
to
the
left

after
going
along
this
hill
track

over
some
poor
and
tottering
bridges

we
joined
the
road
by
which
we
had
driven
to

tornahoish


it
was
fast
getting
dark

but
was
very
fine

i
and
the
girls
got
off
and
walked
sharply
some
little
distance

albert
had
walked
further
on

grant
riding
his
pony
meantime

p

robertson
and
kennedy

besides
those
i
have
named

carried
the
basket
alternately


we
remounted
our
ponies

and
brown
led
mine
on
at
an
amazing
pace
up
the

glaschoil
hill


and
we
finally
reached

gairn
shiel

after
seven

quite
in
the
dark

there

at
the
small
public
house

we
found
the
carriage

and
drove
off
as
soon
as
we
could

the
ponies
were
to
be
given
half
a
feed

and
then
to
come
on

we
had
to
drive
home
very
slowly

as
the
road
is
not
good

and
very
steep
in
parts


a
mild
night

home
by
ten
minutes
past
eight

enchanted
with
our
day

how
i
wish
we
could
travel
about
in
this
way

and
see

all

the
wild
spots
in
the

highlands


we
had
gone
35
miles

having
ridden
19
and
a
half

the
little
girls
were
in
great
glee
the
whole
time





ascent
of

1859



breakfast
at
half
past
eight

at
ten
minutes
to
nine
we
started

in
the
sociable

with
bertie
and
alice
and
our
usual
attendants

drove
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
river

the
day
very
mild
and
promising
to
be
fine

though
a
little
heavy
over
the
hills

which
we
anxiously
watched

at

castleton

we
took
four
post
horses

and
drove
to
the

shiel
of
the
derry


that
beautiful
spot
where
we
were
last
year

which
albert
had
never
seen

and
arrived
there
just
before
eleven

our
ponies
were
there
with
kennedy

robertson

and
jemmie
smith

one
pony
carried
the
luncheon
baskets

after
all
the
cloaks


c

had
been
placed
on
the
ponies

or
carried
by
the
men

we
mounted
and
began
our
â€œjourney
â€
i
was
on
â€œvictoria
â€
alice
on
â€œdobbins
â€
george
mchardy

an
elderly
man
who
knew
the
country

and
acts
as
a
guide

carrying
luggage
for
people
across
the
hills
â€œon
beastsâ€
which
he
keeps
for
that
purpose


led
the
way

we
rode

my
pony
being
led
by
brown
most
of
the
time
both
going
up
and
down

at
least
four
miles
up

glen
derry


which
is
very
fine

with
the
remnants
of
a
splendid
forest


cairn
derry

being
to
the
right

and
the

derry
water

running
below

the
track
was
very
bad
and
stony

and
broken
up
by
cattle
coming
down
for
the
â€œtryst
â€
at
the
end
of
the
glen
we
crossed
a
ford

passed
some
softish
ground

and
turned
up
to
the
left
by
a
very
rough

steep

but
yet
gradual
ascent
to

corrie
etchan


which
is
in
a
very
wild
rugged
spot

with
magnificent
precipices

a
high
mountain
to
the
right
called

ben
main


while
to
the
left
was

cairngorm
of
derry


when
we
reached
the
top
of
this
very
steep
ascent

we
had
been
rising

though
almost
imperceptibly

from
the

derry
shiel



we
came
upon
a
loch
of
the
same
name

which
reminded
us
of

loch
na
gar

and
of

loch
na
nian


you
look
from
here
on
to
other
wild
hills
and
corries

on

ben
aâ€™an



c

we
ascended
very
gradually

but
became
so
enveloped
in
mist
that
we
could
see
nothing

hardly
those
just
before
us

albert
had
walked
a
good
deal

and
it
was
very
cold

the
mist
got
worse

and
as
we
rode
along
the
stony

but
almost
flat
ridge
of

ben
muich
dhui


we
hardly
knew
whether
we
were
on
level
ground
or
the
top
of
the
mountain

however

i
and
alice
rode
to
the
very
top

which
we
reached
a
few
minutes
past
two

and
here

at
a
cairn
of
stones

we
lunched

in
a
piercing
cold
wind


just
as
we
sat
down

a
gust
of
wind
came
and
dispersed
the
mist

which
had
a
most
wonderful
effect

like
a
dissolving
view

and
exhibited
the
grandest

wildest
scenery
imaginable

we
sat
on
a
ridge
of
the
cairn
to
take
our
luncheon


our
good
people
being
grouped
with
the
ponies
near
us

luncheon
over

albert
ran
off
with
alice
to
the
ridge
to
look
at
the
splendid
view

and
sent
for
me
to
follow

i
did
so

but
not
without
grantâ€™s
help

for
there
were
quantities
of
large
loose
stones
heaped
up
together
to
walk
upon

the
wind
was
fearfully
high

but
the
view
was
well
worth
seeing

i
cannot
describe
all

but
we
saw
where
the

dee

rises
between
the
mountains
called
the

well
of
dee
â€”
ben
y
ghlo


and
the
adjacent
mountains


ben
vrackie


then

ben
na
bhourd



ben
aâ€™an



c


and
such
magnificent
wild
rocks

precipices

and
corries

it
had
a
sublime
and
solemn
effect

so
wild

so
solitary

no
one
but
ourselves
and
our
little
party
there


albert
went
on
further
with
the
children

but
i
returned
with
grant
to
my
seat
on
the
cairn

as
i
could
not
scramble
about
well

soon
after

we
all
began
walking
and
looking
for
â€œcairngorms
â€
and
found
some
small
ones

the
mist
had
entirely
cleared
away
below

so
that
we
saw
all
the
beautiful
views


ben

is
4
297
feet
high

one
of
the
highest
mountains
in

scotland


i
and
alice
rode
part
of
the
way

walking
wherever
it
was
very
steep

albert
and
bertie
walked
the
whole
time

i
had
a
little
whisky
and
water

as
the
people
declared
pure
water
would
be
too
chilling

we
then
rode
on
without
getting
off
again

albert
talking
so
gaily
with
grant

upon
which
brown
observed
to
me
in
simple
highland
phrase

â€œitâ€™s
very
pleasant
to
walk
with
a
person
who
is
always
â€™content
â€™â€
yesterday

in
speaking
of
dearest
albertâ€™s
sport

when
i
observed
he
never
was
cross
after
bad
luck

brown
said

â€œevery
one
on
the
estate
says
there
never
was
so
kind
a
master

i
am
sure
our
only
wish
is
to
give
satisfaction
â€
i
said

they
certainly
did

we
were
always
in
the
habit
of
conversing
with
the
highlanders

with
whom
one
comes
so
much
in
contact
in
the
highlands

the
prince
highly
appreciated
the
good
breeding

simplicity

and
intelligence

which
make
it
so
pleasant
and
even
instructive
to
talk
to
them


by
a
quarter
past
six
oâ€™clock
we
got
down
to
the

shiel
of
the
derry


where
we
found
some
tea

which
we
took
in
the
â€œshiel
â€
51

and
started
again
by
moonlight
at
about
half
past
six

we
reached

castleton

at
half
past
seven

and
after
this
it
became
cloudy

at
a
quarter
past
eight
precisely
we
were
at

balmoral


much
delighted
and
not
at
all
tired

everything
had
been
so
well
arranged

and
so
quietly

without
any
fuss


never

shall
i
forget
this
day

or
the
impression
this
very
grand
scene
made
upon
me

truly
sublime
and
impressive

arrived
this
evening
after
a
most
interesting
tour

i
will
recount
the
events
of
the
day

breakfasted
at

balmoral

in
our
own
room
at
half
past
seven
oâ€™clock

and
started
at
eight
or
a
little
past

with
lady
churchill
and
general
grey

in
the
sociable

grant
and
brown
on
the
box
as
usual


for

castleton


where
we
changed
horses

we
went
on
five
miles
beyond
the

linn
of
dee


to
the

shepherdâ€™s
shiel
of
geldie


or

properly
speaking


giuly


where
we
found
our
ponies
and
a
guide

charlie
stewart

we
mounted
at
once

and
rode
up
along
the

geldie


which
we
had
to
ford
frequently
to
avoid
the
bogs

and
rode
on
for
two
hours
up

glen
geldie


over
a
moor
which
was
so
soft
and
boggy
in
places

that
we
had
to
get
off
several
times

the
hills
were
wild

but
not
very
high

bare
of
trees

and
even
of
heather
to
a
great
extent

and
not
picturesque
till
we
approached
the

fishie


and
turned
to
the
right
up
to
the
glen
which
we
could
see
in
the
distance

the

fishie

and

geldie

rise
almost
on
a
level

with
very
little
distance
between
them

the

fishie

is
a
fine
rapid
stream

full
of
stones

as
you
approach
the
glen

which
is
very
narrow

the
scenery
becomes
very
fine

particularly
after
fording
the

etchart


a
very
deep
ford

grant

on
his
pony

led
me
through

our
men
on
foot
took
off
their
shoes
and
stockings
to
get
across

from
this
point
the
narrow
path
winds
along
the
base
of
the
hills
of

craig
na
goâ€™ar


the
rocks
of
the
â€œgoat
craig
â€â€”
craig
na
caillach


and

stron
na
barin


the
nose
of
the
queen
â€
the
rapid
river
is
overhung
by
rocks

with
trees

birch
and
fir

the
hills

as
you
advance

rise
very
steeply
on
both
sides

with
rich
rocks
and
corries

and
occasional
streamlets
falling
from
very
high

while
the
path
winds
along

rising
gradually
higher
and
higher

it
is
quite
magnificent


we
stopped
when
we
came
to
a
level
spot
amongst
the
trees

the
native
firs
are
particularly
fine

and
the
whole
is
grand
in
the
extreme

we
lunched
here

a
charming
spot

at
two
oâ€™clock

and
then
pursued
our
journey

we
walked
on
a
little
way
to
where
the
valley
and
glen
widen
out

and
where
there
is
what
they
call
here
a
green
â€œhard
â€
we
got
on
our
ponies
again
and
crossed
the

fishie


a
stream
we
forded
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
day

to
a
place
where
the
finest
fir
trees
are

amidst
some
of
the
most
beautiful
scenery
possible


then
we
came
upon
a
most
lovely
spot

the
scene
of
all
landseerâ€™s
glory

and
where
there
is
a
little
encampment
of
wooden
and
turf
huts

built
by
the
late
duchess
of
bedford

now
no
longer
belonging
to
the
family

and

alas

all
falling
into
decay

among
splendid
fir
trees

the
mountains
rising
abruptly
from
the
sides
of
the
valley

we
were
quite
enchanted
with
the
beauty
of
the
view

this
place
is
about
seven
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the

fishie


emerging
from
the
wood
we
came
upon
a
good
road

with
low
hills

beautifully
heather
coloured

to
the
left

those
to
the
right

high
and
wooded

with
noble
corries
and
waterfalls


we
met
lord
and
lady
alexander
russell
at
a
small
farm
house

just
as
we
rode
out
of
the
wood

and
had
some
talk
with
them

they
feel
deeply
the
ruin
of
the
place
where
they
formerly
lived

as
it
no
longer
belongs
to
them

we
rode
on
for
a
good
long
distance

12
miles

till
we
came
to
the
ferry
of
the

spey


deer
were
being
driven
in
the
woods

and
we
heard
several
shots

we
saw
fine
ranges
of
hills
on
the

speyside


or

strathspey


and
opening
to
our
left

those
near

loch
laggan


we
came
to
a
wood
of
larch

from
that

upon
cultivated
land

with

kinrara

towards
our
right

where
the
monument
to
the
late
duke
of
gordon
is
conspicuously
seen
on
a
hill

which
was
perfectly
crimson
with
heather


before
entering
the
larch
wood

lord
alexander
russell
caught
us
up
again
in
a
little
pony
carriage

having
to
go
the
same
way

and
he
was
so
good
as
to
explain
everything
to
us

he
showed
us
â€œthe
duke
of
argyllâ€™s
stoneâ€

a
cairn
on
the
top
of
a
hill
to
our
right

celebrated

as
seems
most
probable

from
the
marquis
of
argyll
having
halted
there
with
his
army

we
came
to
another
larch
wood

when
i
and
lady
churchill
got
off
our
ponies

as
we
were
very
stiff
from
riding
so
long

and
at
the
end
of
this
wood
we
came
upon

loch
inch


which
is
lovely

and
of
which
i
should
have
liked
exceedingly
to
have
taken
a
sketch

but
we
were
pressed
for
time
and
hurried

the
light
was
lovely

and
some
cattle
were
crossing
a
narrow
strip
of
grass
across
the
end
of
the
loch
nearest
to
us

which
really
made
a
charming
picture

it
is
not
a
wild
lake

quite
the
contrary

no
high
rocks

but
woods
and
blue
hills
as
a
background

about
a
mile
from
this
was
the
ferry

there
we
parted
from
our
ponies

only
grant
and
brown
coming
on
with
us

walker

the
police
inspector

met
us

but
did
not
keep
with
us

he
had
been
sent
to
order
everything
in
a
quiet
way

without
letting
people
suspect
who
we
were

in
this
he
entirely
succeeded

the
ferry
was
a
very
rude
affair

it
was
like
a
boat
or
coble

but
we
could
only
stand
on
it

and
it
was
moved
at
one
end
by
two
long
oars

plied
by
the
ferryman
and
brown

and
at
the
other
end
by
a
long
sort
of
beam

which
grant
took
in
hand

a
few
seconds
brought
us
over
to
the
road

where
there
were
two
shabby
vehicles

one
a
kind
of
barouche

into
which
albert
and
i
got

lady
churchill
and
general
grey
into
the
other

a
break

each
with
a
pair
of
small
and
rather
miserable
horses

driven
by
a
man
from
the
box

grant
was
on
our
carriage

and
brown
on
the
other

we
had
gone
so
far
40
miles

at
least
20
on
horseback

we
had
decided
to
call
ourselves

lord
and
lady
churchill
and
party


lady
churchill
passing
as

miss
spencer


and
general
grey
as

dr

grey


brown
once
forgot
this

and
called
me
â€œyour
majestyâ€
as
i
was
getting
into
the
carriage

and
grant
on
the
box
once
called
albert
â€œyour
royal
highness
â€
which
set
us
off
laughing

but
no
one
observed
it



illustration


we
had
a
long
three
hoursâ€™
drive

it
was
six
oâ€™clock
when
we
got
into
the
carriage

we
were
soon
out
of
the
wood

and
came
upon
the

badenoch

road

passing
close
by

kinrara


but
unfortunately
not
through
it

which
we
ought
to
have
done

it
was
very
beautiful

fine
wooded
hills

the
high

cairngorm

range

and

ben
muich
dhui


unfortunately
much
obscured
by
the
mist
on
the
top

and
the
broad

spey

flowing
in
the
valley

with
cultivated
fields
and
fine
trees
below

most
striking

however

on
our
whole
long
journey
was
the
utter

and
to
me
very
refreshing

solitude

hardly
a
habitation

and
hardly
meeting
a
soul

it
gradually
grew
dark

we
stopped
at
a
small
half
way
house
for
the
horses
to
take
some
water

and
the
few
people
about
stared
vacantly
at
the
two
simple
vehicles


the
mountains
gradually
disappeared


the
evening
was
mild

with
a
few
drops
of
rain

on
and
on
we
went

till
at
length
we
saw
lights

and
drove
through
a
long
and
straggling
â€œtoun
â€
and
turned
down
a
small
court
to
the
door
of
the
inn

here
we
got
out
quickly

lady
churchill
and
general
grey
not
waiting
for
us

we
went
up
a
small
staircase

and
were
shown
to
our
bed
room
at
the
top
of
it

very
small

but
clean

with
a
large
four
post
bed
which
nearly
filled
the
whole
room

opposite
was
the
drawing
and
dining
room
in
one

very
tidy
and
well
sized

then
came
the
room
where
albert
dressed

which
was
very
small

the
two
maids

jane
shackle
52

was
with
me

had
driven
over
by
another
road
in
the
waggonette

stewart
driving
them

made
ourselves
â€œclean
and
tidy
â€
and
then
sat
down
to
our
dinner

grant
and
brown
were
to
have
waited
on
us

but
were
â€œbashfulâ€
and
did
not

a
ringletted
woman
did
everything

and

when
dinner
was
over

removed
the
cloth
and
placed
the
bottle
of
wine

our
own
which
we
had
brought

on
the
table
with
the
glasses

which
was
the
old
english
fashion

the
dinner
was
very
fair

and
all
very
clean


soup

â€œhodge
podge
â€
mutton
broth
with
vegetables

which
i
did
not
much
relish

fowl
with
white
sauce

good
roast
lamb

very
good
potatoes

besides
one
or
two
other
dishes

which
i
did
not
taste

ending
with
a
good
tart
of
cranberries

after
dinner

i
tried
to
write
part
of
this
account

but
the
talking
round
me
confused
me


while
albert
played
at
â€œpatience
â€
then
went
away

to
begin
undressing

and
it
was
about
half
past
eleven
when
we
got
to
bed



52

one
of
my
wardrobe
maids

and
daughter
to
the
page
mentioned
earlier






wednesday

september
5



a
misty

rainy
morning

had
not
slept
very
soundly

we
got
up
rather
early

and
sat
working
and
reading
in
the
drawing
room
till
the
breakfast
was
ready

for
which
we
had
to
wait
some
little
time

good
tea
and
bread
and
butter

and
some
excellent
porridge

jane
shackle

who
was
very
useful
and
attentive

said
that
they
had
all
supped
together

namely

the
two
maids

and
grant

brown

stewart

and
walker

who
was
still
there


and
were
very
merry
in
the
â€œcommercial
room
â€
the
people
were
very
amusing
about
us

the
woman
came
in
while
they
were
at
their
dinner

and
said
to
grant

â€œdr

grey
wants
you
â€
which
nearly
upset
the
gravity
of
all
the
others

then
they
told
jane

â€œyour
lady
gives
no
trouble
â€
and
grant
in
the
morning
called
up
to
jane

â€œdoes
his
lordship
want
me
â€
one
could
look
on
the
street

which
is
a
very
long
wide
one

with
detached
houses

from
our
window

it
was
perfectly
quiet

no
one
stirring

except
here
and
there
a
man
driving
a
cart

or
a
boy
going
along
on
his
errand

general
grey
bought
himself
a
watch
in
a
shop
for
2
l




at
length

at
about
ten
minutes
to
ten
oâ€™clock

we
started
in
the
same
carriages
and
the
same
way
as
yesterday

and
drove
up
to

castle
grant


lord
seafieldâ€™s
place


a
fine

not
highland
looking

park

with
a
very
plain
looking
house

like
a
factory

about
two
miles
from
the
town

it
was
drizzling
almost
the
whole
time

we
did
not
get
out

but
drove
back

having
to
pass
through

grantown

again

where
evidently
â€œthe
murder
was
out
â€
for
all
the
people
were
in
the
street

and
the
landlady
waved
her
pocket
handkerchief

and
the
ringletted
maid

who
had
curl
papers
in
the
morning

waved
a
flag
from
the
window

our
coachman
evidently
did
not
observe
or
guess
anything

as
we
drove
out
of
the
town

turning
to
our
right
through
a
wood

we
met
many
people
coming
into
the
town

which
the
coachman
said
was
for
a
funeral

we
passed
over
the

spey


by
the

bridge
of
spey


it
continued
provokingly
rainy

the
mist
hanging
very
low
on
the
hills

which

however

did
not
seem
to
be
very
high

but
were
pink
with
heather

we
stopped
to
have
the
cover
of
leather
put
over
our
carriage

which
is
the
fashion
of
all
the
flys
here

it
keeps
out
the
rain

however

very
well


the
first
striking
feature
in
this
country
is
the

pass
of
dal
dhu


above
which
the
road
winds


a
steep
corrie

with
green
hills

we
stopped
at
a
small
inn

with
only
one
other
house
near
it

and
here
the
poor
wretchedly
jaded
horses
got
a
little
water

and
waited
for
about
ten
minutes

further
on
we
came
to
a
very
steep
hill

also
to
a
sort
of
pass

called

glen
bruin


with
green
hills

evidently
of
slate
formation

here
we
got
out

and
walked
down
the
hill

and
over
the

bridge
of
bruin


and
partly
up
another
hill

the
road
winding
amazingly
after
this

up
and
down
hill

we
then
came
in
sight
of
the

avon


winding
below
the
hills

and
again
got
out
at
a
little
wood

before
the

bridge
of
avon


the
river
is
fine
and
clear
here

we
re
entered
our
carriages

lady
churchill
and
i
for
this
short
time
together


and
drove
about
a
mile
further
up
a
hill
to

tomintoul


our
poor
horses
being
hardly
able
to
drag
themselves
any
longer

the
man
whipping
them
and
whistling
to
them
to
go
on

which
they
could
not

and
i
thought
every
instant
that
they
would
stop
in
the
village

we
took
four
hours
to
drive
these
14
miles

for
it
was
two
oâ€™clock
when
we
were
outside
the
town

and
got
out
to
mount
our
ponies


tomintoul

is
the
most
tumble
down

poor
looking
place
i
ever
saw

a
long
street
with
three
inns

miserable
dirty
looking
houses
and
people

and
a
sad
look
of
wretchedness
about
it

grant
told
me
that
it
was
the
dirtiest

poorest
village
in
the
whole
of
the

highlands



we
mounted
our
ponies
a
short
way
out
of
the
town

but
only
rode
for
a
few
minutes
as
it
was
past
two
oâ€™clock

we
came
upon
a
beautiful
view

looking
down
upon
the

avon

and
up
a
fine
glen

there
we
rested
and
took
luncheon

while
brown
was
unpacking
and
arranging
our
things

i
spoke
to
him
and
to
grant

who
was
helping

about
not
having
waited
on
us

as
they
ought
to
have
done

at
dinner
last
night
and
at
breakfast

as
we
had
wished

and
brown
answered

he
was
afraid
he
should
not
do
it
rightly

i
replied
we
did
not
wish
to
have
a
stranger
in
the
room

and
they
must
do
so
another
time


luncheon

provisions
for
which
we
had
taken
with
us
from
home
yesterday

finished

we
started
again

walked
a
little
way

till
we
were
overtaken
by
the
men
and
ponies

and
then
rode
along

avonside


the
road
winding
at
the
bottom
of
the
glen

which
is
in
part
tolerably
wide

but
narrows
as
it
turns

and
winds
round
towards

inchrory


where
it
is
called

glen
avon


the
hills

sloping
down
to
the
river
side

are
beautifully
green

it
was
very
muggy

quite
oppressive

and
the
greater
part
of
the
road
deep
and
sloppy

till
we
came
upon
the
granite
formation
again

in
order
to
get
on

as
it
was
late

and
we
had
eight
miles
to
ride

our
men


at
least
brown
and
two
of
the
others


walked
before
us
at
a
fearful
pace

so
that
we
had
to
trot
to
keep
up
at
all

grant
rode
frequently
on
the
deer
pony

the
others
seemed

however

a
good
deal
tired
with
the
two
long
daysâ€™
journey

and
were
glad
to
get
on
albertâ€™s
or
the
generalâ€™s
pony
to
give
themselves
a
lift

but
their
willingness

readiness

cheerfulness

indefatigableness

are
very
admirable

and
make
them
most
delightful
servants

as
for
grant
and
brown
they
are
perfect

discreet

careful

intelligent

attentive

ever
ready
to
do
what
is
wanted

and
the
latter

particularly

is
handy
and
willing
to
do
everything
and
anything

and
to
overcome
every
difficulty

which
makes
him
one
of
my
best
servants
anywhere


we
passed
by

inchrory


seeing

as
we
approached

two
eagles
towering
splendidly
above

and
alighting
on
the
top
of
the
hills

from

inchrory


we
rode
to

loch
bulig


which
was
beautifully
lit
up
by
the
setting
sun

from

tomintoul

we
escaped
all
real
rain

having
only
a
slight
sprinkling
every
now
and
then

at

loch
bulig

we
found
our
carriage
and
four
ponies

and
drove
back
just
as
we
left
yesterday
morning

reaching

balmoral

safely
at
half
past
seven


what
a
delightful

successful
expedition

dear
lady
churchill
was

as
usual

thoroughly
amiable

cheerful

and
ready
to
do
everything

both
she
and
the
general
seemed
entirely
to
enjoy
it

and
enter
into
it

and
so
i
am
sure
did
our
people

to
my
dear
albert
do
we
owe
it

for
he
always
thought
it
would
be
delightful

having
gone
on
many
similar
expeditions
in
former
days
himself

he
enjoyed
it
very
much

we
heard
since
that
the
secret
came
out
through
a
man
recognizing
albert
in
the
street
yesterday
morning

then
the
crown
on
the
dog
cart
made
them
think
that
it
was
some
one
from

balmoral


though
they
never
suspected
that
it
could
be
ourselves

â€œthe
lady
must
be
terrible
rich
â€
the
woman
observed

as
i
had
so
many
gold
rings
on
my
fingers


i
told
lady
churchill
she
had
on
many
more
than
i
had

when
they
heard
who
it
was

they
were
ready
to
drop
with
astonishment
and
fright

i
fear
i
have
but
poorly
recounted
this
very
amusing
and
never
to
be
forgotten
expedition

which
will
always
be
remembered
with
delight


i
must
pay
a
tribute
to
our
ponies

dear
â€œfyvieâ€
is
perfection

and
albertâ€™s
equally
excellent





second
great
expedition


to
invermark
and
fettercairn






friday

september
20

1861



looked
anxiously
at
the
weather
at
seven
oâ€™clock

there
had
been
a
little
rain

there
was
still
mist
on
the
hills

and
it
looked
doubtful

however

albert
said
it
would
be
best
to
keep
to
the
original
arrangements

and
so
we
got
up
early

and
by
eight
the
sun
shone

and
the
mist
began
to
lift
everywhere

we
breakfasted
at
half
past
eight

and
at
half
past
nine
we
started
in
two
sociables

alice
and
louis
53

with
us
in
the
first

and
grant
on
the
box

lady
churchill
and
general
grey
in
the
second

and
brown
on
the
box

we
drove
to
the

bridge
of
muich


where
we
found
our
six
ponies

and
five
gillies

j

smith

j

morgan

kennedy

c

stewart

and
s

campbell


we
rode
up
the
peat
road
over
the
hill
of

polach

and
down
it
again
for
about
four
miles

and
then
came
to
a
very
soft
bit

but
still
with
careful
management
we
avoided
getting
into
any
of
the
bogs

and
i
remained
on
my
pony
all
the
time

albert
and
louis
had
to
get
off
and
walk
for
about
two
hundred
yards

the
hills
of

loch
na
gar

were
very
hazy

but

mount
keen

was
in
great
beauty
before
us

and
as
we
came
down
to
the

glen
of
corrie
vruach


and
looked
down

glen
tanar


the
scenery
was
grand
and
wild


mount
keen

is
a
curious
conical
shaped
hill

with
a
deep
corrie
in
it

it
is
nearly
3
200
feet
high

and
we
had
a
very
steep
rough
ascent
over
the
shoulder

after
crossing
the

tanar
water


it
was
six
and
a
half
miles
from
the

bridge
of
muich

to

corrie
vruach




53

prince
louis
of
hesse


when
we
were
on
the
level
ground
again

where
it
was
hard
and
dry

we
all
got
off
and
walked
on
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill

we
had
not
gone
far
when
we
descried
lord
dalhousie

whom
general
grey
had
in
confidence
informed
of
our
coming

on
a
pony

he
welcomed
us
on
the
border
of
his
â€œmarch
â€
got
off
his
pony
and
walked
with
us

after
walking
some
little
time
alice
and
i
remounted
our
ponies


albert
riding
some
part
of
the
time


and
turned
to
the
left

when
we
came
in
sight
of
a
new
country

and
looked
down
a
very
fine
glen


glen
mark


we
descended
by
a
very
steep
but
winding
path

called

the
ladder


very
grand
and
wild

the
water
running
through
it
is
called

the
ladder
burn


it
is
very
fine
indeed

and
very
striking

there
is
a
small
foresterâ€™s
lodge
at
the
very
foot
of
it

the
pass
is
quite
a
narrow
one

you
wind
along
a
very
steep
and
rough
path

but
still
it
was
quite
easy
to
ride
on
it

as
it
zigzags
along

we
crossed
the
burn
at
the
bottom

where
a
picturesque
group
of
â€œshearersâ€
were
seated

chiefly
women

the
older
ones
smoking

they
were
returning
from
the
south
to
the
north

whence
they
came

we
rode
up
to
the
little
cottage

and
in
a
little
room
of
a
regular
highland
cabin

with
its
usual
â€œpress
bed
â€
we
had
luncheon

this
place
is
called

invermark


and
is
four
and
a
half
miles
from

corrie
vruach


after
luncheon
i
sketched
the
fine
view

the
steep
hill
we
came
down
immediately
opposite
the
keeperâ€™s
lodge
is
called

craig
boestock


and
a
very
fine
isolated
craggy
hill
which
rises
to
the
left

over
topping
a
small
and
wild
glen

is
called
the

hill
of
doun



we
mounted
our
ponies
a
little
after
three

and
rode
down

glen
mark


stopping
to
drink
some
water
out
of
a
very
pure
well

called

the
white
well


and
crossing
the

mark

several
times

as
we
approached
the

manse
of
loch
lee


the
glen
widened

and
the
old

castle
of
invermark

came
out
extremely
well

and

surrounded
by
woods
and
corn
fields

in
which
the
people
were
â€œshearing
â€
looked
most
picturesque

we
turned
to
the
right

and
rode
up
to
the
old
ruined
castle

which
is
half
covered
with
ivy

we
then
rode
up
to
lord
dalhousieâ€™s
shooting
lodge

where
we
dismounted

it
is
a
new
and
very
pretty
house

built
of
granite

in
a
very
fine
position
overlooking
the
glen

with
wild
hills
at
the
back

miss
maule

now
lady
c

maule

was
there

we
passed
through
the
drawing
room

and
went
on
a
few
yards
to
the
end
of
a
walk
whence
you
see

loch
lee


a
wild

but
not
large

lake
closed
in
by
mountains

with
a
farm
house
and
a
few
cottages
at
its
edge

the
hall
and
dining
room
are
very
prettily
fitted
up
with
trophies
of
sport

and
the
walls
panelled
with
light
wood

we
had
a
few
of
the
very
short
showers
which
hung
about
the
hills

we
then
got
into
our
carriages

the
carriage
we
were
in
was
a
sort
of
double
dog
cart
which
could
carry
eight

but
was
very
narrow
inside

we
drove
along
the
glen

down
by
the

northesk


the

ey

and

mark

meeting
become
the

northesk



passing
to
the
right
another
very
pretty
glen


glen
effach


much
wooded

and
the
whole
landscape
beautifully
lit
up

before
us
all
was
light
and
bright

and
behind
the
mist
and
rain
seemed
to
come
down
heavily
over
the
mountains


further
on
we
passed

poul
skeinnie
bridge

and

tarf
bridge


both
regular
steep
highland
bridges

to
the
right
of
the
latter
there
is
a
new
free
kirk

further
on

captain
wemyssâ€™s
retreat


a
strange
looking
place


to
the
left

mill
dane


and

on
a
small
eminence

the

castle
of
auch
mill


which
now
resembles
an
old
farm
house

but
has
traces
of
a
terrace
garden
remaining

the
hills
round
it
and
near
the
road
to
the
left
were
like
small
mounds

a
little
further
on
again
we
came
to
a
wood

where
we
got
out
and
walked
along

the
burn


major
mcinroyâ€™s

the
path
winds
along
through
the
wood
just
above
this
most
curious
narrow
gorge

which
is
unlike
any
of
the
other
lynns

the
rocks
are
very
peculiar

and
the
burn
very
narrow

with
deep
pools
completely
overhung
by
wood

it
extends
some
way

the
woods
and
grounds
might
be
in

wales


or
even
in

hawthornden


we
walked
through
the
wood
and
a
little
way
along
the
road

till
the
carriages
overtook
us

we
had
three
miles
further
to
drive
to

fettercairn


in
all
40
miles
from

balmoral


we
came
upon
a
flat
country

evidently
much
cultivated

but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything


at
a
quarter
past
seven
oâ€™clock
we
reached
the
small
quiet
town

or
rather
village

of

fettercairn


for
it
was
very
small

not
a
creature
stirring

and
we
got
out
at
the
quiet
little
inn

â€œramsay
arms
â€
quite
unobserved

and
went
at
once
upstairs

there
was
a
very
nice
drawing
room

and
next
to
it

a
dining
room

both
very
clean
and
tidy

then
to
the
left
our
bed
room

which
was
excessively
small

but
also
very
clean
and
neat

and
much
better
furnished
than
at

grantown


alice
had
a
nice
room

the
same
size
as
ours

then
came
a
mere
morsel
of
one


with
a
â€œpress
bed
â€

in
which
albert
dressed

and
then
came
lady
churchillâ€™s
bed
room
just
beyond

louis
and
general
grey
had
rooms
in
an
hotel

called
â€œthe
temperance
hotel
â€
opposite

we
dined
at
eight

a
very
nice

clean

good
dinner

grant
and
brown
waited

they
were
rather
nervous

but
general
grey
and
lady
churchill
carved

and
they
had
only
to
change
the
plates

which
brown
soon
got
into
the
way
of
doing

a
little
girl
of
the
house
came
in
to
help

but
grant
turned
her
round
to
prevent
her
looking
at
us

the
landlord
and
landlady
knew
who
we
were

but

no
one
else

except
the
coachman

and
they
kept
the
secret
admirably


the
evening
being
bright
and
moonlight
and
very
still

we
all
went
out

and
walked
through
the
whole
village

where
not
a
creature
moved


through
the
principal
little
square

in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
sort
of
pillar
or
town
cross
on
steps

and
louis
read

by
the
light
of
the
moon

a
proclamation
for
collections
of
charities
which
was
stuck
on
it

we
walked
on
along
a
lane
a
short
way

hearing
nothing
whatever

not
a
leaf
moving

but
the
distant
barking
of
a
dog

suddenly
we
heard
a
drum
and
fifes

we
were
greatly
alarmed

fearing
we
had
been
recognized

but
louis
and
general
grey

who
went
back

saw
nothing
whatever

still

as
we
walked
slowly
back

we
heard
the
noise
from
time
to
time


and
when
we
reached
the
inn
door
we
stopped

and
saw
six
men
march
up
with
fifes
and
a
drum

not
a
creature
taking
any
notice
of
them


go
down
the
street

and
back
again

grant
and
brown
were
out

but
had
no
idea
what
it
could
be

albert
asked
the
little
maid

and
the
answer
was

â€œitâ€™s
just
a
band
â€
and
that
it
walked
about
in
this
way
twice
a
week

how
odd

it
went
on
playing
some
time
after
we
got
home

we
sat
till
half
past
ten
working

and
albert
reading


and
then
retired
to
rest






saturday

september
21



got
to
sleep
after
two
or
three
oâ€™clock

the
morning
was
dull
and
close

and
misty
with
a
little
rain

hardly
any
one
stirring

but
a
few
people
at
their
work

a
traveller
had
arrived
at
night

and
wanted
to
come
up
into
the
dining
room

which
is
the
â€œcommercial
travellersâ€™
room
â€
and
they
had
difficulty
in
telling
him
he
could

not

stop
there

he
joined
grant
and
brown
at
their
tea

and
on
his
asking

â€œwhatâ€™s
the
matter
here
â€
grant
answered

â€œitâ€™s
a
wedding
party
from

aberdeen

â€
at
â€œthe
temperance
hotelâ€
they
were
very
anxious
to
know
whom
they
had
got

all

except
general
grey

breakfasted
a
little
before
nine

brown
acted
as
my
servant

brushing
my
skirt
and
boots

and
taking
any
message

and
grant
as
albertâ€™s
valet


at
a
quarter
to
ten
we
started
the
same
way
as
before

except
that
we
were
in
the
carriage
which
lady
churchill
and
the
general
had
yesterday

it
was
unfortunately
misty

and
we
could
see
no
distance

the
people
had
just
discovered
who
we
were

and
a
few
cheered
us
as
we
went
along

we
passed
close
to

fettercairn


sir
j

forbesâ€™s
house

then
further
on
to
the
left


fasque


belonging
to
sir
t

gladstone

who
has
evidently
done
a
great
deal
for
the
country

having
built
many
good
cottages

we
then
came
to
a
very
long
hill

at
least
four
miles
in
length

called
the

cairnie
month


whence
there
is
a
very
fine
view

but
which
was
entirely
obscured
by
a
heavy
driving
mist

we
walked
up
part
of
it

and
then
for
a
little
while
alice
and
i
sat
alone
in
the
carriage

we
next
came
to
the

spittal
bridge


a
curious
high
bridge
with
the

dye
water

to
the
left

and
the

spittal
burn

to
the
right

sir
t

gladstoneâ€™s
shooting
place
is
close
to
the

bridge
of
dye


where
we
changed
carriages
again

re
entering
the
double
dog
cart

albert
and
i
inside

and
louis
sitting
behind

we
went
up
a
hill
again
and
saw

mount
battock

to
the
north
west

close
to
sir
t

gladstoneâ€™s
shooting
lodge

you
then
come
to
an
open
country

with
an
extensive
view
towards

aberdeen


and
to
a
very
deep

rough
ford

where
you
pass
the

feugh


at
a
place
called

white
stones


it
is
very
pretty
and
a
fine
glen
with
wood

about
two
miles
further
to
the
north
west

on
the
left

is

finzean


and

a
little
beyond

is
â€œking
durdunâ€™s
stone
â€
as
they
call
it

by
the
roadside

a
large

heavy

ancient
stone


the
history
of
which

however

we
have
not
yet
discovered

then
we
passed

maryâ€™s
well


to
the
left
of
which
is

ballogie
house


a
fine
property
belonging
to
mr

dyce
nicol

the
harvest
and
everything
seemed
prosperous

and
the
country
was
very
pretty

we
got
out
at
a
very
small
village


where
the
horses
had
some
water

for
it
was
a
terribly
long
stage


and
walked
a
little
way
along
the
road

alice

lady
churchill

and
i

went
into
the
house
of
a
tailor

which
was
very
tidy

and
the
woman
in
it
most
friendly

asking
us
to
rest
there

but
not
dreaming
who
we
were


we
drove
on
again

watching
ominous
looking
clouds

which

however

cleared
off
afterwards

we
saw
the
woods
of
lord
huntlyâ€™s
forest

and
the
hills
which
one
sees
from
the
road
to

aboyne


instead
of
going
on
to

aboyne

we
turned
to
the
left

leaving
the

bridge
of
aboyne


which
we
had
not
seen
before

to
the
right

a
little
beyond
this

out
of
sight
of
all
habitations

we
found
the
postmaster

with
another
carriage
for
us

this
was
22
miles
from

fettercairn


we
crossed
the

tanar
water


and
drove
to
the
left
up

glen
tanar


a
really
beautiful
and
richly
wooded
glen

between
high
hills

part
of
lord
huntlyâ€™s
forest

we
drove
on
about
six
miles

and
then
stopped

as
it
was
past
two

to
get
our
luncheon

the
day
kept
quite
fair
in
spite
of
threatening
clouds
and
gathering
mist

the
spot
where
we
lunched
was
very
pretty

this
over

we
walked
on
a
little

and
then
got
into
the
carriages
again

and
drove
to
the
end
of
the
glen

out
of
the
trees
to

eatnoch


on
to
a
keeperâ€™s
house
in
the
glen

a
very
lonely
place

where
our
ponies
were

it
was
about
four
when
we
arrived

a
wretched
idiot
girl
was
here
by
herself

as
tall
as
lady
churchill

but
a
good
deal
bent

and
dressed
like
a
child

with
a
pinafore
and
short
cut
hair

she
sat
on
the
ground
with
her
hands
round
her
knees

rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
laughing

she
then
got
up
and
walked
towards
us

general
grey
put
himself
before
me

and
she
went
up
to
him

and
began
taking
hold
of
his
coat

and
putting
her
hand
into
his
pockets

which
set
us
all
off
laughing

sad
as
it
was

an
old
man
walked
up
hastily
soon
after

and
on
lady
churchill
asking
him
if
he
knew
that
poor
girl

he
said

â€œyes

she
belongs
to
me

she
has
a
weakness
in
her
mind
â€
and
led
her
off
hurriedly


we
walked
on
a
few
hundred
yards

and
then
mounted
our
ponies
a
little
higher
up

and
then
proceeded
across
the
other
shoulder
of
the
hill
we
had
come
down
yesterday

crossed
the
boggy
part

and
came
over
the

polach

just
as
in
going

the
mist
on
the
distant
hills


mount
keen



c


made
it
feel
chilly

coming
down
the
peat
road
54

to
the

bridge
of
muich


the
view
of
the
valleys
of

muich



gairn


and

ballater

was
beautiful

as
we
went
along
i
talked
frequently
with
good
grant



54

grant
told
me
in
may

1862

that

when
the
prince
stopped
behind
with
him

looking
at
the
choils
which
he
intended
as
a
deer
forest
for
the
prince
of
wales

and
giving
his
directions
as
to
the
planting
in
glen
muich

he
said
to
grant
â€”â€œyou
and
i
may
be
dead
and
gone
before
that
â€
in
less
than
three
months

alas

his
words
were
verified
as
regards
himself

he
was
ever
cheerful

but
ever
ready
and
prepared


we
found
my
dearest
motherâ€™s
sociable

a
fine
large
one

which
she
has
left
to
albert

waiting
to
take
us
back

it
made
me
very
sad

and
filled
my
eyes
with
tears

oh

in
the
midst
of
cheerfulness

i
feel
so
sad

but
being
out
a
great
deal
here

and
seeing
new
and
fine
scenery

does
me
good


we
got
back
to

balmoral


much
pleased
with
our
expedition

at
seven
oâ€™clock

we
had
gone
42
miles
to
day

and
40
yesterday

in
all
82





expedition
to
loch
avon






saturday

september
28

1861



looked
out
very
anxiously

a
doubtful
morning

still
gleams
of
sunshine
burst
through
the
mist

and
it
seemed
improving
all
round

we
breakfasted
at
a
quarter
to
eight

with
alice
and
louis

in
our
sitting
room

and
started
at
half
past
eight

louis
and
alice
with
us

grant
and
brown
on
the
box

as
usual

the
morning
greatly
improved


we
drove
along
the
north
side
of
the
river

the
day
clearing
very
much

and
becoming
really
fine

we
took
post
horses
at

castleton


and
drove
up
to
the

derry


the
road
up

glen
luie

very
bad
indeed


and
here
we
mounted
our
ponies

and
proceeded
the
usual
way
up

glen
derry


as
far
as
where
the
path
turns
up
to

loch
etchan


instead
of
going
that
way

we
proceeded
straight
on

a
dreadfully
rough

stony
road

though
not
steep

but
rougher
than
anything
we
ever
rode
upon
before

and
terrible
for
the
poor
horsesâ€™
feet

we
passed
by
two
little
lakes
called
the

dhoolochans


opposite
to
where
the
glen
runs
down
to

inchrory


and
after
crossing
them

there
was
a
short
boggy
bit

where
i
got
off
and
walked
some
way
on
the
opposite
side

along
the
â€œbraeâ€
of
the
hill

on
the
other
side
of
which
the
loch
lies

and
then
got
on
again

it
was
so
saturated
with
water

that
the
moss
and
grass
and
everything
were
soaked


not
very
pleasant
riding

particularly
as
it
was
along
the
slope
of
the
hill

we
went
on
and
on

nearly
two
miles
from
the
foot
of
this
hill

expecting
to
see
the
loch

but
another
low
hill
hid
it
from
us

till
at
length
we
came
in
sight
of
it

and
nothing
could
be
grander
and
wilder

the
rocks
are
so
grand
and
precipitous

and
the
snow
on

ben
muich
dhui

had
such
a
fine
effect


we
saw
the
spot
at
the
foot
of

loch
etchan

to
which
we
scrambled
last
year

and
looked
down
upon

loch
avon


it
was
very
cold
and
windy

at
length

at
a
quarter
past
two

we
sat
down
behind
a
large
stone
a
little
above
the
loch

unfortunately

we
could
not
go
to
the
extreme
end

where
the
water
rushes
into
it


we
lunched
as
quickly
as
we
could

and
then
began
walking
back

and
crossed
the
hill
higher
up
than
in
coming

i
walked
for
some
time

but
it
was
not
easy

from
the
great
wet
and
the
very
uneven
ground

good
louis
helped
me
often

albert
and
alice
running
along
without
assistance

remounted
my
pony

which

as
well
as
albertâ€™s

went
beautifully

carefully
led
by
that
most
attentive
of
servants

brown

i
had
again
to
get
off
before
we
crossed
by
the

dhoolochans


but
after
that
we
rode
back
the
whole
way


we
had
the
same
guide

charlie
stewart

who
took
us
to

glen
fishie

last
year

and
who
walks
wonderfully

we
had
two
slight
showers
going
down

and
saw
that
there
had
been
much
more
rain
below

we
found
the

ford
of
the
derry

very
deep

nearly
up
to
the
poniesâ€™
girths

and
the
roughness
and
stoniness
of
the
road
is
beyond
everything

but
the
ponies
picked
their
way
like
cats

we
were
down
at
the

derry

by
nearly
six
oâ€™clock

the
distance
to

loch
avon

being
ten
miles

found
our
carriages
there

it
was
already
getting
darkish

but
still
it
was
quite
light
enough
to
enable
the
post
boys
to
see
their
way


at
the
bridge
at

mar
lodge


brown
lit
the
lanterns

we
gave
him
and
grant
our
plaids
to
put
on

as
we
always
do
when
they
have
walked
a
long
way
with
us
and
drive
afterwards

we
took
our
own
horses
at

castleton


and
reached

balmoral

at
ten
minutes
past
eight

much
pleased
with
the
success
of
our
expedition

and
really

not

tired

we
dined

en
famille

tuesday

october
8

1861



the
morning
was
dull
and
rather
overcast

however

we
decided
to
go

general
grey
had
gone
on
before

we
three
ladies
drove
in
the
sociable

albert
and
louis
in
a
carriage
from

castleton


the
clouds
looked
heavy
and
dark

though
not
like
mist
hanging
on
the
mountains

down
came
a
heavy
shower

but
before
we
reached

castleton

it
cleared

blue
sky
appeared

and

as
there
was
much
wind

grant
thought
all
would
be
well

and
the
day
very
fine

changed
horses
at

castleton


and
drove
beyond
the

linn
of
dee

to
the

giuly

or

geldie
water


just
where
last
year
we
mounted
our
ponies

18
miles
from

balmoral


here
we
found
our
ponies

â€œinchroryâ€
for
me

and
a
new
pony
for
alice

a
tall
grey
one

ugly
but
safe

the
others
rode
their
usual
ones

the
same
guide

charlie
stewart

was
there

and
a
pony
for
the
luncheon
panniers

and
a
spare
one
for
grant
and
others
to
ride
in
turn


we
started
about
ten
minutes
past
eleven

and
proceeded
exactly
as
last
year

fording
the

geldie

at
first
very
frequently

the
ground
was
wet

but
not
worse
than
last
year

we
had
gone
on
very
well
for
about
an
hour

when
the
mist
thickened
all
round

and
down
came
heavy

or
at
least
beating

rain
with
wind

with
the
help
of
an
umbrella

and
waterproofs
and
a
plaid

i
kept
quite
dry

dearest
albert

who
walked
from
the
time
the
ground
became
boggy

got
very
wet

but
was
none
the
worse
for
it

and
we
got
through
it
much
better
than
before

we
ladies
never
having
to
get
off
our
ponies

at
length
at
two
oâ€™clock

just
as
we
were
entering
that
beautiful

glen
fishie


which
at
its
commencement
reminds
one
of

the
burn


mcinroyâ€™s


it
cleared
and
became
quite
fine
and
very
mild

brown
waded
through
the

etchart

leading
my
pony

and
then
two
of
the
others

who
were
riding
together
on
another
pony

dropped
the
whole
bundle
of
cloaks
into
the
water


the
falls
of
the

stron
na
barin


with
that
narrow
steep
glen

which
you
ride
up

crossing
at
the
bottom

were
in
great
beauty

we
stopped
before
we
entered
the
wood

and
lunched
on
the
bank
overhanging
the
river

where
general
grey
joined
us

and
gave
us
an
account
of
his
arrangements

we
lunched
rather
hurriedly

remounted
our
ponies
and
rode
a
short
way

till
we
came
near
to
a
very
steep
place

not
very
pleasant
to
ride

so
fine

numberless
little
burns
running
down
in
cascades

we
walked
a
short
way

and
then
remounted
our
ponies

but
as
we
were
to
keep
on
the
other
side
of
the
river

not
by
the

invereshie

huts

we
had
to
get
off
for
a
few
hundred
yards

the
path
being
so
narrow
as
to
make
it
utterly
unsafe
to
ride

aliceâ€™s
pony
already
began
to
slip

the
huts

surrounded
by
magnificent
fir
trees

and
by
quantities
of
juniper
bushes

looked
lovelier
than
ever

and
we
gazed
with
sorrow
at
their
utter
ruin

i
felt
what
a
delightful
little
encampment
it
must
have
been

and
how
enchanting
to
live
in
such
a
spot
as
this
beautiful
solitary
wood
in
a
glen
surrounded
by
the
high
hills

we
got
off

and
went
into
one
of
the
huts
to
look
at
a
fresco
of
stags
of
landseerâ€™s

over
a
chimney
piece

grant

on
a
pony

led
me
through
the

fishie


all
the
fords
are
deep

at
the
foot
of
the
farm
houses

where
we
met
lord
and
lady
alexander
russell
last
year

and
where
we
this
time
found
two
carriages

we
dismounted
and
entered
them

and
were
off
at
five
oâ€™clock

we
were
to
have
started
at
four


we
four
drove
together
by
the
same
way
as
we
rode
last
year

and
nothing
could
be
rougher
for
driving


quite
to
the
second
wood

which
led
us
past

loch
inch


but
we
turned
short
of
the
loch
to
the
left
along
the
high
road

unfortunately
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
dark

and
we
therefore
lost
a
great
deal
of
the
fine
scenery

we
had
ridden
15
miles

we
drove
along
the
road
over
several
bridges

the

bridge
of
carr


close
below
the
ruined

castle
of
ruthven


which
we
could
just
descry
in
the
dusk

and
on
a
long
wooden
bridge
over
the

spey

to
an
inn
at

kingussie


a
very
straggling
place
with
very
few
cottages

already

before
we
arrived
there

we
were
struck
by
people
standing
at
their
cottage
doors

and
evidently
looking
out

which
made
us
believe
we
were
expected

at

kingussie

there
was
a
small

curious

chattering
crowd
of
people

who

however

did
not
really
make
us
out

but
evidently
suspected
who
we
were

grant
and
brown
kept
them
off
the
carriages

and
gave
them
evasive
answers

directing
them
to
the
wrong
carriage

which
was
most
amusing

one
old
gentleman

with
a
high
wide
awake

was
especially
inquisitive


we
started
again

and
went
on
and
on

passing
through
the
village
of

newtonmoore


where
the
footman
mcdonald
55

comes
from

here
the

spey

is
crossed
at
its
junction
with
the

truim


and
then
the
road
ascends
for
ten
miles
more
to

dalwhinnie


it
became
cold
and
windy
with
occasional
rain

at
length

and
not
till
a
quarter
to
nine

we
reached
the
inn
of

dalwhinnie



29
miles
from
where
we
had
left
our
ponies


which
stands
by
itself

away
from
any
village

here

again

there
were
a
few
people
assembled

and
i
thought
they
knew
us

but
it
seems
they
did
not

and
it
was
only
when
we
arrived
that
one
of
the
maids
recognized
me

she
had
seen
me
at

aberdeen

and

edinburgh


we
went
upstairs

the
inn
was
much
larger
than
at

fettercairn


but
not
nearly
so
nice
and
cheerful

there
was
a
drawing
room
and
a
dining
room

and
we
had
a
very
good
sized
bed
room

albert
had
a
dressing
room
of
equal
size

mary
andrews
56


who
was
very
useful
and
efficient

and
lady
churchillâ€™s
maid
had
a
room
together

every
one
being
in
the
house

but
unfortunately
there
was
hardly
anything
to
eat

and
there
was
only
tea

and
two
miserable
starved
highland
chickens

without
any
potatoes

no
pudding

and
no

fun


no
little
maid

the
two
there
not
wishing
to
come
in


nor
our
two
people

who
were
wet
and
drying
our
and
their
things

to
wait
on
us

it
was
not
a
nice
supper

and
the
evening
was
wet

as
it
was
late
we
soon
retired
to
rest

mary
and
maxted

lady
churchillâ€™s
maid

had
been
dining
below
with
grant

brown

and
stewart

who
came

the
same
as
last
time

with
the
maids

in
the
â€œcommercial
roomâ€
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs

they
had
only
the
remnants
of
our
two
starved
chickens

wednesday

october
9



a
bright
morning

which
was
very
charming

albert
found

on
getting
up

that
cluny
macpherson

with
his
piper
and
two
ladies

had
arrived
quite
early
in
the
morning

and

while
we
were
dressing

we
heard
a
drum
and
fife

and
discovered
that
the
newly
formed
volunteers
had
arrived

all
indicating
that
we
were
discovered

however

there
was
scarcely
any
population

and
it
did
not
signify

the
fat
old
landlady
had
put
on
a
black
satin
dress

with
white
ribbons
and
orange
flowers

we
had
breakfast
at
a
quarter
to
nine
oâ€™clock

at
half
past
nine
we
started

cluny
was
at
the
door
with
his
wife
and
daughters
with
nosegays

and
the
volunteers
were
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
inn

they
had
all
assembled
since
saturday
afternoon


we
drove
as
we
did
yesterday

fine
and
very
wild
scenery

high
wild
hills

and
no
habitations

we
went
by
the

pass
of
drumouchter


with
fine
hills
on
both
sides
and
in
front
of
us

passed
between
two

the
one
on
our
left
called

the
boar
of
badenoch


and
that
on
the
right


the
athole
sow


the

pass
of
drumouchter

separates

perthshire

from

inverness
shire



again

a
little
farther
on

we
came
to

loch
garry


which
is
very
beautiful

but
the
mist
covered
the
furthest
hills

and
the
extreme
distance
was
clouded

there
is
a
small
shooting
lodge

or
farm

charmingly
situated

looking
up
the
glen
on
both
sides

and
with
the
loch
in
front

we
did
not
hear
to
whom
it
belonged

we
passed
many
drovers

without
their
herds
and
flocks

returning

grant
told
us

from

falkirk


we
had
one
very
heavy
shower
after

loch
garry

and
before
we
came
to

dalnacardoch
inn


13
miles
from

dalwhinnie


the
road
goes
beside
the

garry


the
country
for
a
time
became
flatter

but
was
a
good
deal
cultivated

at

dalnacardoch
inn

there
was
a
suspicion
and
expectation
of
our
arrival

four
horses
with
smart
postilions
were
in
waiting

but

on
general
greyâ€™s
saying
that
this
was

not

the
party

but
the
one
for
whom
only
two
horses
had
been
ordered

a
shabby
pair
of
horses
were
put
in

a
shabby
driver
driving
from
the
box

as
throughout
this
journey


and
off
we
started


the

garry

is
very
fine

rolling
along
over
large
stones

like
the

quoich

and
the

fishie


and
forming
perpetual
falls

with
birch
and
mountain
ash
growing
down
to
the
waterâ€™s
edge

we
had
some
more
heavy
showers

a
few
miles
from

dalnacardoch

the
duke
of
athole

in
his
kilt
and
shooting
jacket

as
usual

met
us
on
a
pretty
little
chestnut
pony

and
rode
the
whole
time
near
the
carriage

he
said

there
were
vague
suspicions
and
rumours
of
our
coming

but
he
had
told
no
one
anything

there
was
again
a
shower

but
it
cleared
when
we
came
in
sight
of

ben
y
ghlo


and
the
splendid

pass
of
killiekrankie


which

with
the
birch
all
golden


not

as
on

deeside


bereft
of
leaves


looked
very
beautiful


we
passed
by
the

bruar


and
the
road
to
the

falls
of
the
bruar


but
could
not
stop

the
duke
took
us
through
a
new
approach

which
is
extremely
pretty

but
near
which

i
cannot
help
regretting

the
railroad
will
come

as
well
as
along
the
road
by
which
we
drove
through
the

pass
of
drumouchter


the
duke
has
made
great
improvements

and
the
path
looked
beautiful

surrounded
as
it
is
by
hills

and
the
foliage
still
full

though
in
all
its
autumn
tints

the
whole
being
lit
up
with
bright
sunshine

we
drove
through
an
avenue

and
in
a
few
minutes
more
were
at
the
door
of
the
old
castle

a
thousand
recollections
of
seventeen
years
ago
crowded
upon
me

all
seemed
so
familiar
again

no
one
there
except
the
dear
duchess

who
stood
at
the
door

and
whom
i
warmly
embraced

and
miss
mac
gregor

how
well
i
recognized
the
hall
with
all
the
sporting
trophies

and
the
staircase

which
we
went
up
at
once

the
duchess
took
us
to
a
room
which
i
recognized
immediately
as
the
one
where
lady
canning
lived

there
we
took
off
our
things

then
went
to
look
at
the
old
and
really
very
handsome
rooms
in
which
we
had
lived

the
one
in
which
vicky
had
slept
in
two
chairs

then
not
four
years
old

in
the
dining
room
we
took
some
coffee

which
was
most
welcome

and
then
we
looked
at
all
the
stagsâ€™
horns
put
up
in
one
of
the
corridors
below

saw
the
dukeâ€™s
pet
dog

a
smooth
haired
black
terrier

very
fat

and
then
got
into
the
carriage

a
very
peculiar
one

viz


a

boat


a
mere
boat

which
is
very
light


put
on
four
wheels

drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
with
a
postilion

into
this
we
four
got

with
the
duke
and
duchess
and
the
dog


lady
churchill

general
grey

and
miss
mac
gregor
going
in
another
carriage

with
our
two
servants
on
the
box

to
whom
all
this
was
quite
new
and
a
great
treat

the
morning
was
beautiful

it
was
half
past
twelve

we
drove
up
by
the
avenue
and
about
a
favourite
walk
of
ours
in
â€™44

passed
through
the
gate

and
came
on
to

glen
tilt


which
is
most
striking

the
road
winding
along

first
on
one
side
of
the

tilt


and
then
on
the
other

the
fine
high
hills
rising
very
abruptly
from
each
side
of
the
rapid

rocky

stony
river

tilt


the
trees

chiefly
birch
and
alder

overhanging
the
water


we
passed
the

marble
lodge


in
which
one
of
the
keepers
lives

and
came
to

forest
lodge


where
the
road
for
carriages
ends

and
the
glen
widens

there
were
our
ponies

which
had
passed
the
night
at
the

bainoch

or

beynoch


a
shooting
â€œshielâ€
of
lord
fifeâ€™s


they
came
over
this
morning

but

poor
beasts

without
having
had
any
corn


forest
lodge

is
eight
miles
from

blair


there
we
took
leave
of
the
dear
duchess

and
saw
old
peter
frazer

the
former
head
keeper
there

now
walking
with
the
aid
of
two
sticks

the
dukeâ€™s
keepers
were
there

his
pipers

and
a
gentleman
staying
on
a
visit
with
him


it
was
barely
two
oâ€™clock
when
we
started

we
on
our
ponies

the
duke
and
his
men

twelve
altogether

on
foot

sandy
mcara

now
head
keeper

grown
old
and
grey

and
two
pipers

preceded
us

the
two
latter
playing
alternately
the
whole
time

which
had
a
most
cheerful
effect

the
wild
strains
sounded
so
softly
amid
those
noble
hills

and
our
caravan
winding
along

our
people
and
the
dukeâ€™s
all
in
kilts

and
the
ponies

made
altogether
a
most
picturesque
scene


one
of
the
dukeâ€™s
keepers

donald
macbeath

is
a
guardsman

and
was
in
the

crimea


he
is
a
celebrated
marksman

and
a
fine
looking
man

as
all
the
dukeâ€™s
men
are

for
some
little
time
it
was
easy
riding

but
soon
we
came
to
a
rougher
path

more
on
the
â€œbraeâ€
of
the
hill

where
the
pony
required
to
be
led

which
i
always
have
done

either
when
it
is
at
all
rough
or
bad

or
when
the
pony
has
to
be
got
on
faster


the
duke
walked
near
me
the
greater
part
of
the
time

amusingly
saying

in
reference
to
former
times

that
he
did
not
offer
to
lead
me

as
he
knew
i
had
no
confidence
in
him

i
replied

laughingly

â€œoh

no

only
i
like
best
being
led
by
the
person
i
am
accustomed
to
â€

at
length

at
about
three

we
stopped

and
lunched
at
a
place
called

dalcronachie


looking
up
a
glen
towards

loch
loch


on
a
high
bank
overhanging
the

tilt


looking
back
the
view
was
very
fine

so

while
the
things
were
being
unpacked
for
lunch

we
sketched

we
brought
our
own
luncheon

and
the
remainder
was
as
usual
given
to
the
men

but
this
time
there
were
a
great
many
to
feed

after
luncheon
we
set
off
again

i
walked
a
few
paces

but
as
it
was
very
wet

and
the
road
very
rough

by
albertâ€™s
desire
i
got
on
again

a
very
few
minutes
brought
us
to
the
celebrated
ford
of
the

tarff




poll
tarff

it
is
called


which
is
very
deep

and
after
heavy
rain
almost
impassable

the
duke
offered
to
lead
the
pony
on
one
side

and
talked
of
sandy
for
the
other
side

but
i
asked
for
brown

whom
i
have
far
the
most
confidence
in

to
lead
the
pony

the
duke
taking
hold
of
it

as
he
did
frequently

on
the
other
side

sandy
mcara

the
guide

and
the
two
pipers
went
first

playing
all
the
time

to
all
appearance
the
ford
of
the

tarff

was
not
deeper
than
the
other
fords

but
once
in
it
the
men
were
above
their
knees

and
suddenly
in
the
middle

where
the
current

from
the
fine

high

full
falls

is
very
strong

it
was
nearly
up
to
the
menâ€™s
waists

here
sandy
returned

and
i
said
to
the
duke

which
he
afterwards
joked
with
sandy
about

that
i
thought
he

sandy

had
better
take
the
dukeâ€™s
place

he
did
so

and
we
came
very
well
through

all
the
others
following

the
men
chiefly
wading

albert

close
behind
me

and
the
others
riding
through

and
some
of
our
people
coming
over
double
on
the
ponies

general
grey
had
little
peter
robertson
up
behind
him


the
road
after
this
became
almost
precipitous

and
indeed
made
riding
very
unpleasant

but
being
wet

and
difficult
to
walk

we
ladies
rode

albert
walking
the
greater
part
of
the
time

only
once

for
a
very
few
steps

i
had
to
get
off

as
the
pony
could
hardly
keep
its
footing

as
it
was

brown
constantly
could
not
walk
next
to
the
pony

but
had
to
scramble
below

or
pull
it
after
him

the
duke
was
indefatigable



illustration

fording
the
poll
tarf



after
a
drawing
by
carl
haag




the

tilt

becomes
narrower
and
narrower

till
its
first
source
is
almost
invisible

the

tarff

flows
into
the

tilt


about
two
miles
or
more
beyond
the
falls

we
emerged
from
the
pass
upon
an
open
valley

with
less
high
hills
and
with
the
hills
of

braemar

before
us

we
crossed
the

bainoch

or

bynack


quite
a
small
stream

and
when
we
came
to
the
â€œcounty
marchâ€

where

perth

and

aberdeen

join

we
halted

the
duke
gave
albert
and
me
some
whisky
to
drink

out
of
an
old
silver
flask
of
his
own

and
then
made
a
short
speech
proposing
my
health

expressing
the
pleasure
with
which
he
and
all
had
received
me
at

blair


and
hoping
that
i
would
return
as
often
as
i
liked

and
that
i
should
have
a
safe
return
home

ending
by
the
true

which
went
admirably

rather

the

we
then
went
on
again
for
about
three
miles
to
the

bainoch


which
we
reached
at
ten
minutes
to
six

when
it
was
already
nearly
dark

as
we
approached
the

the

struck
up

and
played

the

so
well

altogether
it

very
kindly
come
down
to
the

bainoch

herself

where
she
gave
us
tea

which
was
very
welcome

we
then
got
into
our
carriages

wishing
the
good
duke
of
athole
good
by

he
was
going
back
the
whole
way

which
was
certainly
rather
a
hazardous
proceeding

at
least
an
adventurous
one

considering
the
night

and
that
there
was
no
moon

and
what
the
road
was

we
got
home
safely
at
a
quarter
past
eight

the
night
was
quite
warm

though
slightly
showery

but
became
very
clear
and
starlight
later


we
had
travelled
69
miles
to

and

yesterday

this
was
the
pleasantest
and
most
enjoyable
expedition
i

ever

made

and
the
recollection
of
it
will
always
be
most
agreeable

nothing

wednesday

16

1861



to
our
great
satisfaction
it
was
a
most
beautiful
morning

not
a
cloud
was
on
the
bright
blue
sky

and
it
was
perfectly
calm

there
had
been
a
sharp
frost
which
lay
on
parts
of
the
grass

and
the
mountains
were
beautifully
lit
up

with
those
very
blue
shades
upon
them

like
the
bloom
on
a
plum

up
early

and
breakfasted
with
alice

louis

and
lenchen

in
our
room

at
twenty
minutes
to
nine
oâ€™clock
we
started

with
alice

lenchen

and
louis

the
morning
was
beyond
everything
splendid

and
the
country
in
such
beauty

though
the
poor
trees
are
nearly
leafless


near

castleton


and
indeed
all
along
the
road

in
the
shade

the
frost
still
lay

and
the
air
was
very
sharp

we
took
post
horses
at

castleton


and
proceeded
up

glen
clunie

to

glen
callater


which
looked
lovely

and
which
albert
admired
much

in
a
little
more
than
two
hours
we
were
at

loch
callater


the
road
was
very
bad
indeed
as
we
approached
the
loch

where
our
ponies
were
waiting
for
us

after
walking
a
few
paces
we
remounted
them

i
on
my
good
â€œfyvie
â€
and
alice
on
â€œinchrory
â€

the
day
was
glorious

and
the
whole
expedition
delightful

and
very
easily
performed

we
ascended

little
cairn
turc


on
the
north
side
of

loch
callater


up
a
sort
of
footpath
very
easy
and
even

upon
ground
that
was
almost
flat

rising
very
gradually

but
imperceptibly

and
the
view
became
wonderfully
extensive

the
top
of

cairn
turc

is
quite
flat

with
moss
and
grass

so
that
you
could
drive
upon
it

it
is
very
high

for
you
see
the
high
table
land
behind
the
highest
point
of

loch
na
gar


on
that
side
you
have
no
view

but
from
the
other
it
is
wonderfully
extensive

it
was
so
clear
and
bright

and
so
still
there

reminding
us
of
the
day
on

ben
muich
dhui

last
year


there
rose
immediately
behind
us

ben
muich
dhui


which
you
hardly
ever
see

and
the
shape
of
which
is
not
fine

with
its
surrounding
mountains
of

cairngorm

ben
avon

or

c

we
saw

ben
y
ghlo

quite
clearly

and
all
that
range
of
hills

then

further
west


shichallion


near

loch
tay


the
mountains
which
are
near
the

black
mount


and

quite
on
the
horizon

we
could
discern

ben
nevis


which
is
above

fort
william



going
up

cairn
turc

we
looked
down
upon

loch
canter


a
small
loch
above

loch
callater


very
wild
and
dark

we
proceeded
to

cairn
glaishie


at
the
extreme
point
of
which
a
cairn
has
been
erected

we
got
off
to
take
a
look
at
the
wonderful
panorama
which
lay
stretched
out
before
us

we
looked
on

fifeshire


and
the
country
between

perth

and

stirling


the

lomond
hills



c

it
was
beautifully
clear

and
really
it
was
most
interesting
to
look
over
such
an
immense
extent
of
the

highlands


i
give
a
very
poor
description
of
it

but
here

we
walked
on
a
little
way

and
then
i
got
upon
my
pony

another
half
hourâ€™s
riding
again
over
such
singular
flat
table
land

brought
us
on
to
the
edge
of
the
valley
of

cairn
lochan


which
is
indeed
â€œa
bonnie
place
â€
it
reminded
me
and
louis
of

clova


only
there
one
did
not
see
the
immense
extent
of
mountains
behind


cairn
lochan

is
a
narrow
valley

the
river

isla

winding
through
it
like
a
silver
ribbon

with
trees
at
the
bottom

the
hills
are
green
and
steep

but
towards
the
head
of
the
valley
there
are
fine
precipices

we
had
then
to
take
a
somewhat
circuitous
route
in
order
to
avoid
some
bogs

and
to
come
to
a
spot
where
we
looked
right
up
the
valley
for
an
immense
distance

to
the
left

or
rather
more
to
the
south

was

glen
isla


another
glen

but
wider

and
not
with
the
same
high
mountains
as

cairn
lochan


beyond

glen
isla

were
seen
the

lomond
hills

behind

kinross


at
the
foot
of
which
is

loch
leven



we
sat
on
a
very
precipitous
place

which
made
one
dread
any
oneâ€™s
moving
backwards

and
here

at
a
little
before
two
oâ€™clock

we
lunched

the
lights
were
charmingly
soft

and

as
i
said
before

like
the
bloom
on
a
plum

the
luncheon
was
very
acceptable

for
the
air
was
extremely
keen

and
we
found
ice
thicker
than
a
shilling
on
the
top
of

cairn
turc


which
did
not
melt
when
brown
took
it
and
kept
it
in
his
hand


helena
was
so
delighted

for
this
was

the
only
really
great

expedition
in
which
she
had
accompanied
us


duncan
and
the
keeper
at

loch
callater


r

stewart

went
with
us
as
guides



i
made
some
hasty
sketches

and
then
albert
wrote
on
a
bit
of
paper
that
we
had
lunched
here

put
it
into
the
selters
water
bottle

and
buried
it
there

or
rather
stuck
it
into
the
ground

grant
had
done
the
same
when
we
visited

ben
muich
dhui

the
first
time

this
over

we
walked
part
of
the
way
back
which
we
had
ridden
to
avoid
the
bogs


we
ladies
walking
only
a
short
way

and
then
riding

we
altered
our
course

and
left

cairn
glaishie

to
our
right

and
went
in
the
direction
of
the

cairn
wall


looking
back
on
the
distant
hills
above

glen

and

cairn
lochan


lord
airlieâ€™s
â€œcountryâ€


it
was
even
more
beautiful

for

as
the
day
advanced

the
mountains
became
clearer
and
clearer

of
a
lovely
blue

while
the
valleys
were
in
shadow


shichallion


and
those
further
ranges

were
also
most
perfectly
to
be
seen

and
gave
me
such
a
longing
for
further
highland
expeditions

we
went
over

garbchory


looking
down
on
the
road
to
the

spittal


and
on
the
lower
mountains

which
are
most
curiously
connected
one
with
another

and
which

from
the
height
we
were

we
could
look
down
upon

this
gave
one
a
very
good
idea
of
the
geography
of
the
country

which
delighted
dear
albert

as
this
expedition
was
quite
in
a
different
direction
from
any
that
we
had
ever
made
before

but
my
head
is
so
very
ungeographical

that
i
cannot
describe
it

we
came
down
by
the

month
eigie


a
steep
hill
covered
with
grass

down
part
of
which
i
rode

walking
where
it
was
steepest

but
it
was
so
wet
and
slippery
that
i
had
two
falls

we
got
down
to
the
road
to
the

spittal
bridge


about
15
miles
from

castleton


at
nearly
half
past
four

and
then
down
along
the
new
road

at
least
that
part
of
it
which
is
finished

and
which
is
to
extend
to
the

cairn
wall


we
went
back
on
our
side
of
the
river

and
if
we
had
been
a
little
earlier

albert
might
have
got
a
stag

but
it
was
too
late

the
moon
rose
and
shone
most
beautifully

and
we
returned
at
twenty
minutes
to
seven
oâ€™clock

much
pleased
and
interested
with
this
delightful
expedition

alas

i
fear
our

last

great
one




it
was
our
last
one

thursday

august
2

1849



arrived
here
after
a
quick
but
not
very
pleasant
passage

the
day
was
fine
and
bright

and
the
sea
to
all
appearance
very
smooth

but
there
was
a
dreadful
swell

which
made
one
incapable
of
reading
or
doing
anything

we
passed
the

landâ€™s
end

at
nine
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning

when
we
went
on
deck
after
eight
in
the
evening

we
were
close
to
the

cove
of
cork


and
could
see
many
bonfires
on
the
hill

and
the
rockets
and
lights
that
were
sent
off
from
the
different
steamers

the
harbour
is
immense

though
the
land
is
not
very
high

and
entering
by
twilight
it
had
a
very
fine

friday

august
3



the
day
was
grey
and
excessively
â€œmuggy
â€
which
is
the
character
of
the
irish
climate

the
ships
saluted
at
eight
oâ€™clock

and
the
â€œgangesâ€

and
the
â€œhogueâ€

a
three
decker
cut
down

with
very
heavy
guns

and
with
a
screw
put
into
her


which
are
both
very
near
us

made
a
great
noise

the
harbour
is
very
extensive

and
there
are
several
islands
in
it

one
of
which
is
very
large


spike
island

is
immediately
opposite
us

and
has
a
convict
prison

near
it
another
island

the
depã´t


c

in
a
line
with
that
is
the
town
of

picturesquely
built
up
a
hill

the
two
war
steamers
have
only
just
come
in

the
admiral

dixon

and
the
captains
of
the
vessels
came
on

lord
lieutenant
of
the
county


lord
thomond

general
turner

commander
of
the
forces
at
cork

presented
their
respects

and
albert
went
on
shore

and
i
occupied
myself
in
writing
and
sketching

albert
returned
before
our
luncheon

and
had
been
walking
about
and
visiting
some
of
the
cabins


we
left
the
yacht
at
two
with
the
ladies
and
gentlemen

and
went
on
board
the
â€œfairy
â€
which
was
surrounded
with
rowing
and
sailing
boats

we
first
went
round
the
harbour

all
the
ships
saluting

as
well
as
numbers
of
steamers
and
yachts

we
then
went
into

cove

and
lay
alongside
the
landing
place

which
was
very
prettily
decorated

and
covered
with
people

and
yachts

ships
and
boats
crowding
all
round

the
two
members

messrs

roche
and
power

as
well
as
other
gentlemen

including
the
roman
catholic
and
protestant
clergymen

and
then
the
members
of
the
yacht
club

presented
addresses

after
which

to
give
the
people
the
satisfaction
of
calling
the
place

queenstown


in
honour
of
its
being
the
first
spot
on
which
i
set
foot
upon
irish
ground

i
stepped
on
shore
amidst
the
roar
of
cannon

for
the
artillery
were
placed
so
close
as
quite
to
shake
the
temporary
room
which
we
entered


and
the
enthusiastic
shouts
of
the
people

we
immediately
re
embarked
and
proceeded
up
the
river

lee

towards

cork


it
is
extremely
pretty
and
richly
wooded

and
reminded
me
of
the

tamar


the
first
feature
of
interest
we
passed
was
a
little
bathing
place

called

monkstown


and
later

blackrock
castle


at
which
point
we
stopped
to
receive
a
salmon

and
a
very
pretty
address
from
the
poor
fishermen
of

blackrock



as
we
approached
the
city
we
saw
people
streaming
in

on
foot

on
horseback

and
many
in
jaunting
cars

when
we
reached

cork

the
â€œfairyâ€
again
lay
alongside

and
we
received
all
the
addresses

first

from
the
mayor
and
corporation

i
knighted
the
mayor
immediately
afterwards


then
from
the
protestant
bishop
and
clergy

from
the
roman
catholic
bishop
and
clergy

from
the
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county

the
sheriffs

and
others

the
two
judges

who
were
holding
their
courts

also
came
on
board
in
their
robes

after
all
this
was
over
we
landed

and
walked
some
few
paces
on
to
where
lord
bandonâ€™s
carriage
was
ready
to
receive
us

the
ladies
went
with
us

and
lord
bandon
and
the
general
rode
on
each
side
of
the
carriage

the
mayor
preceded
us

and
many

lord
listowel
among
the
number


followed
on
horseback
or
in
carriages

the
12th
lancers
escorted
us

and
the
pensioners
and
infantry
lined
the
streets


i
cannot
describe
our
route

but
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
it
took
two
hours

that
we
drove
through
the
principal
streets

twice
through
some
of
them

that
they
were
densely
crowded

decorated
with
flowers
and
triumphal
arches

that
the
heat
and
dust
were
great

that
we
passed
by
the
new
college
which
is
building

one
of
the
four
which
are
ordered
by
act
of
parliament

that
our
reception
was
most
enthusiastic

and
that
everything
went
off
to
perfection

and
was
very
well
arranged


cork

is
not
at
all
like
an
english
town

and
looks
rather
foreign


the
crowd
is
a
noisy

excitable

but
very
good
humoured
one

running
and
pushing
about

and
laughing

talking

and
shrieking

the
beauty
of
the
women
is
very
remarkable

and
struck
us
much

such
beautiful
dark
eyes
and
hair

and
such
fine
teeth

almost
every
third
woman
was
pretty

and
some
remarkably
so

they
wear
no
bonnets

and
generally
long
blue
cloaks

the
men
are
very
poorly

often
raggedly
dressed

and
many
wear
blue
coats
and
short
breeches
with
blue
stockings


we
re
embarked
at
the
same
place
and
returned
just
as
we
came






kingstown

sunday

continue
my
account

for
the
first
two
hours
and
a
half
the
sea

though
rough

was
not
disagreeable

we
entered

waterford
harbour

yesterday
at
twenty
minutes
to
four
oâ€™clock

the
harbour
is
rocky
on
the
right
as
one
enters

and
very
flat
to
the
left

as
one
proceeds
the
land
rises
on
either
side

we
passed
a
little
fort
called

duncannon
fort


whence
james
ii

embarked
after
the
battle
of
the

boyne


and
from
which
they
had
not
saluted
for
fifty
years

further
up

between
two
little
villages

one
on
either
side

each
with
its
little
chapel

picturesquely
situated
on
the
top
of
the
rock
or
hill

we
anchored

the
little
fishing
place
to
our
left
is
called

passage


and
is
famous
for
salmon

we
had
an
excellent
specimen
for
our
dinner

albert
decided
on
going
to

waterford


ten
miles
up
the
river

in
the
â€œfairy
â€
with
the
boys

but
as
i
felt
giddy
and
tired

i
preferred
remaining
quietly
on
board
sketching

albert
returned
after
seven
oâ€™clock

he
had
not
landed






viceregal
lodge

phå“nix

monday

august
6



here
we
are
in
this
very
pretty
spot

with
a
lovely
view
of
the

wicklow
hills

from
the
window

but
now
to
return
to
yesterdayâ€™s
proceedings

we
got
under
weigh
at
half
past
eight
oâ€™clock

for
three
hours
it
was
dreadfully
rough

and
i
and
the
poor
children
were
very
sea
sick

when
we
had
passed
the

tuscan
rock

in

wexford

the
sea
became
smoother

and
shortly
after

quite
smooth

and
the
evening
beautiful

after
we
passed

arklow
head


the

wicklow
hills

came
in
sight

they
are
beautiful

the

sugarloaf

and

carrick
mountain

have
finely
pointed
outlines

with
low
hills
in
front
and
much
wood

at
half
past
six
we
came
in
sight
of

dublin
bay


and
were
met
by
the
â€œsphynxâ€
and
â€œstromboliâ€

which
had
been
sent
on
to
wait
and
to
come
in
with
us


the
â€œtrident
â€
and

quite
close
to
the
harbour

by
the
â€œdragon
â€
another
war
steamer

with
this
large
squadron
we
steamed
slowly
and
majestically
into
the
harbour
of

kingstown


which
was
covered
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
spectators

cheering
most
enthusiastically

it
is
a
splendid
harbour

and
was
full
of
ships
of
every
kind

the
wharf

where
the
landing
place
was
prepared

was
densely
crowded

and
altogether
it
was
a
noble
and
stirring
scene

it
was
just
seven
when
we
entered

and
the
setting
sun
lit
up
the
country

the
fine
buildings

and
the
whole
scene
with
a
glowing
light

which
was
truly
beautiful

we
were
soon
surrounded
by
boats

and
the
enthusiasm
and
excitement
of
the
people
were
extreme


while
we
were
at
breakfast
the
yacht
was
brought
close
up
to
the
wharf

which
was
lined
with
troops

lord
and
lady
clarendon
and
george
58

came
on
board

also
lords
lansdowne
and
clanricarde

the
primate

the
archbishop
of
dublin

and
many
others

the
address
was
presented
by
the
sheriff
and
gentlemen
of
the
county

as
the
clock
struck
ten
we
disembarked

stepping
on
shore
from
the
yacht

albert
leading
me
and
the
children

and
all
the
others
following
us

an
immense
multitude
had
assembled

who
cheered
most
enthusiastically

the
ships
saluting
and
the
bands
playing

and
it
was
really
very
striking

the
space
we
had
to
walk
along
to
the
railroad
was
covered
in

and
lined
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
strewing
flowers

we
entered
the
railway
carriages
with
the
children

the
clarendons

and
the
three
ladies

and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
reached
the
dublin
station

here
we
found
our
carriages
with
the
postilions
in
their
ascot
liveries

the
two
eldest
children
went
with
us

and
the
two
younger
ones
with
the
three
ladies

sir
edward
blakeney

commander
in
chief
in
ireland

rode
on
one
side
of
the
carriage
and
george
on
the
other

followed
by
a
brilliant
staff

and
escorted
by
the
17th
lancers
and
the
carabiniers



58

the
duke
of
cambridge


it
was
a
wonderful
and
striking
scene

such
masses
of
human
beings

so
enthusiastic

so
excited

yet
such
perfect
order
maintained

then
the
numbers
of
troops

the
different
bands
stationed
at
certain
distances

the
waving
of
hats
and
handkerchiefs

the
bursts
of
welcome
which
rent
the
air


all
made
it
a
never
to
be
forgotten
scene

when
one
reflected
how
lately
the
country
had
been
in
open
revolt
and
under
martial
law



dublin

is
a
very
fine
city

and

sackville
street

and

merrion
square

are
remarkably
large
and
handsome

and
the

bank



trinity
college



c

are
noble
buildings

there
are
no
gates
to
the
town

but
temporary
ones
were
erected
under
an
arch

and
here
we
stopped

and
the
mayor
presented
me
the
keys
with
some
appropriate
words

at
the
last
triumphal
arch
a
poor
little
dove
was
let
down
into
my
lap

with
an
olive
branch
round
its
neck

alive
and
very
tame

the
heat
and
dust
were
tremendous

we
reached

phå“nix
park


which
is
very
extensive

at
twelve

lord
and
lady
clarendon
and
all
the
household
received
us
at
the
door

it
is
a
nice
comfortable
house

reminding
us
of

claremont


with
a
pretty
terrace
garden
in
front

laid
out
by
lady
normanby


and
has
a
very
extensive
view
of
the

park

and
the
fine
range
of
the

wicklow
mountains


we
are
most
comfortably
lodged

and
have
very
nice
rooms






tuesday

august
7



we
drove
into

dublin


with
our
two
ladies

in
lord
clarendonâ€™s
carriage

the
gentlemen
following

and
without
any
escort

the
people
were
very
enthusiastic

and
cheered
a
great
deal

we
went

first

to
the

bank


where
the
directors
received
us

and
then
to
the
printing
room

and
from
thence
viewed
the
old
houses
of
lords
and
commons

for
what
is
now
the

bank

was
the
old
parliament
house

from
here
we
drove
to
the

model
school


where
we
were
received
by
the
archbishop
of
dublin

the
roman
catholic
archbishop
murray

a
fine
venerable
looking
old
man
of
eighty


and
the
other
gentlemen
connected
with
the
school

we
saw
the

infant


the

girlsâ€™


and
the

boysâ€™
schools


in
the
latter

one
class
of
boys
was
examined
in
mental
arithmetic
and
in
many
very
difficult
things

and
they
all
answered
wonderfully

children
of
all
creeds
are
admitted

and
their
different
doctrines
are
taught
separately

if
the
parents
wish
it

but
the

only

teaching
enforced
is
that
of
the
gospel
truths

and
love
and
charity

this
is
truly
christian
and
ought
to
be
the
case
everywhere

about
1
000
children
are
educated
here
annually

of
which
300
are
trained
as
schoolmasters
and
mistresses

from
here
we
visited

trinity
college


the
irish
university

which
is
not
conducted
upon
so
liberal
a
system

but
into
which
roman
catholics
are
admitted

dr

todd

the
secretary

and
a
very
learned
man

well
versed
in
the
irish
language

showed
us
some
most
interesting
ancient
manuscripts
and
relics

including
st

columbaâ€™s
book

in
which
we
wrote
our
names


and
the
original
harp
of
king
oâ€™brian

supposed
to
be
the
one
from
which
the
irish
arms
are
taken

the
library
is
a
very
large
handsome
room

like
that
in

trinity
college

cambridge


we
then
proceeded
towards
home

the
crowd
in
the
streets
immense

and
so
loyal

it
rained

and
his

saw
the
old
pensioners

the
chapel

and
the

fine
large
room

where
all

and

though

were
not
expected

the

great

is
one
of
the
kindest
and
best
of
men


after
luncheon
we
walked
out
and
saw
some
of
the
country
people
dance
jigs

which
was
very
amusing

the
irish
is
quite
different
from
the
scotch
reel

not
so
animated

and
the
steps
different

but
very
droll

the
people
were
very
poorly
dressed
in
thick
coats

and
the
women
in
shawls

there
was
one
man
who
was
a
regular
specimen
of
an
irishman

with
his
hat
on
one
ear

others
in
blue
coats

with
short
breeches
and
blue
stockings

there
were
three
old
and
tattered
pipers
playing

the
irish
pipe
is
very
different
from
the
scotch

it
is
very
weak

and
they
donâ€™t
blow
into
it

but
merely
have
small
bellows
which
they
move
with
the
arm

we
walked
round
the
pleasure
grounds

and
after
this
got
into
a
carriage
with
the
duke
and
duchess

our
ladies
and
gentlemen
following
in
a
large
jaunting
car

and
the
people
riding

running

and
driving
with
us

but
extremely
well
behaved

and
the
duke
is
so
kind
to
them

that
a
word
from
him
will
make
them
do
anything

it
was
very
hot

and
yet
the
people
kept
running
the
whole
way

and
in
the
thick
woollen
coats

which
it
seems
they
always
wear
here

we
drove
along
the
park
to
a
spot
which
commands
an
extensive
view
of
the

wicklow
hills


we
then
went
down
an
entirely
new
road

cut
out
of
the
solid
rock

through
a
beautiful
valley

full
of
the
finest
trees

growing
among
rocks
close
to
a
piece
of
water

we
got
out
and
walked
across
a
little
wooden
bridge
to
a
very
pretty
little
cottage

entirely
ornamented
with
shells


c

by
the
duchess

we
drove
back
in
the
jaunting
car

which
is
a
double
one

with
four
wheels

and
held
a
number
of
us

i
sitting
on
one
side
between
albert
and
the
duke

the
duchess

lady
jocelyn

lord
clarendon

and
lady
waterford
on
the
opposite
side

george
at
the
back

and
the
equerries
on
either
side
of
the
coachman


as
soon
as
we
returned
to
the
house
we
took
leave
of
our
hosts

and
went
back
to
the

phå“nix
park

a
different
way
from
the
one
we
came

along
the
banks
of
the

liffey


through
mr

colsonâ€™s
park

in
which
there
were
the
most
splendid
beeches
i
have
ever
seen

feathering
down
quite
to
the
ground

and
farther
along
the
road
and
river
were
some
lovely
sycamore
trees

we
drove
through
the
village
of

lucan


where
there
were
fine
decorations
and
arches
of
bays
and
laurel

we
passed
below

the
strawberry
beds


which
are
really
curious
to
see

quite
high
banks
of
them

and
numbers
of
people
come
from

dublin

to
eat
these
strawberries

and
there
are
rooms
at
the
bottom
of
these
banks
on
purpose

we
were
home
a
little
after
five






on
board
the
victoria
and
albert



in
loch
ryan

sunday

august
12



we
arrived
after
a
dreadfully
rough
though
very
short
passage

and
have
taken
refuge
here

to
return
to
friday

we
left
the

phå“nix
park


where
we
had
spent
so
pleasant
a
time

at
six
oâ€™clock

lord
clarendon
and
the
two
elder
children
going
in
the
carriage
with
us

and
drove
with
an
escort
to
the
dublin
railway
station

the
town
was
immensely
crowded

and
the
people
most
enthusiastic

george
met
us
there

and
we
took
him

the
clarendons

and
lord
lansdowne
and
our
ladies
in
the
carriage
with
us

we
arrived
speedily
at

kingstown


where
there
were
just
as
many
people
and
as
much
enthusiasm
as
on
the
occasion
of
our
disembarkation

we
stood
on
the
paddle
box
as
we
slowly
steamed
out
of

kingstown


amidst
the
cheers
of
thousands
and
thousands

and
salutes
from
all
the
ships

and
i
waved
my
handkerchief
as
a
parting
acknowledgment
of
their
loyalty

we
soon
passed

howth

and

irelandâ€™s
eye


the
ship
was
very
steady

though
the
sea
was
not
smooth

and
the
night
thick
and
rainy

and
we
feared
a
storm
was
coming
on






saturday

august
11



we
reached

belfast
harbour

at
four
oâ€™clock

the
wind
had
got
up
amazingly

and
the
morning
was
a
very
bad
and
stormy
one


we
had
not
had
a
very
quiet
night
for
sleeping

though
very
smooth

the
weather
got
worse
and
worse

and
blew
a
real
gale

and
it
was
quite
doubtful
whether
we
could
start
as
we
had
intended

on
our
return
from

belfast


for

scotland



we
saw
the
mayor
and
general

bainbrigg


who
had
come
on
board
after
breakfast


at
a
quarter
past
one
we
started
with
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
for
the
â€œfairy
â€
though
we
had
only
two
minutesâ€™
row
in
the
barge

there
was
such
a
swell
that
the
getting
in
and
out

and
the
rolling
and
tossing
in
the
boat

were
very
disagreeable

we
had
to
keep
in
the
little
pavilion

as
the
squalls
were
so
violent
as
to
cover
the
â€œfairyâ€
with
spray

we
passed
between

holywood

and

carrickfergus


celebrated
for
the
first
landing
of
william
iii

we
reached

belfast

in
half
an
hour

and
fortunately
the
sun
came
out


we
lay
close
alongside
the
wharf

where
a
very
fine
landing
place
was
arranged

and
where
thousands
were
assembled

lord
londonderry
came
on
board

and
numerous
deputations
with
addresses

including
the
mayor

whom
i
knighted


the
protestant
bishop
of
down
and
clergy

the
catholic
bishop
denvir

an
excellent
and
modest
man


the
sheriff
and
members
for
the
county

with
lord
donegal

to
whom
the
greater
part
of

belfast

belongs


dr

henry

from
the
new
college

and
the
presbyterians

of
whom
there
are
a
great
many
here


lady
londonderry
and
her
daughter
also
came
on
board

there
was
some
delay
in
getting
the
gang
board
down

as
they
had
made
much
too
large
a
one

some
planks
on
board
were
arranged

and
we
landed
easily
in
this
way

the
landing
place
was
covered
in

and
very
tastefully
decorated

we
got
into
lord
londonderryâ€™s
carriage
with
the
two
ladies

and
lord
londonderry
himself
got
on
the
rumble
behind
with
the
two
sergeant
footmen

renwick
and
birbage

both
very
tall

large
men

and
the
three
must
have
been
far
from
comfortable


the
town
was
beautifully
decorated
with
flowers

hangings

and
very
fine
triumphal
arches

the
galleries
full
of
people

and
the
reception
very
hearty

the
people
are
a
mixture
of
nations

and
the
female
beauty
had
almost
disappeared


i
have
all
along
forgotten
to
say
that
the
favourite
motto
written
up
on
most
of
the
arches


c


and
in
every
place

was

â€œcead
mile
failte
â€
which
means
â€œa
hundred
thousand
welcomesâ€
in
irish

which
is
very
like
gaelic

it
is
in
fact

the

language

and
has
existed
in
books
from
the
earliest
period

whereas
gaelic
has
only
been

written

since
half
a
century

though
it
was
always

spoken


they
often
called
out

â€œcead
mile
failte
â€
and
it
appears
in
every
sort
of
shape


lord
donegal
rode
on
one
side
of
the
carriage
and
the
general
on
the
other

we
stopped
at
the

linen
hall

to
see
the
exhibition
of
the
flax
and
linen
manufacture

lord
downshire
and
several
other
gentlemen
received
us
there

and
conducted
us
through
the
different
rooms

where
we
saw
the
whole
process
in
its
different
stages

first
the
plant

then
the
flax
after
being
steeped

then
the
spun
flax

lastly

the
linen

cambric

and
cloth
of
every
sort
and
kind

it
is
really
very
interesting
to
see

and
it
is
wonderful
to
what
a
state
of
perfection
it
has
been
brought


we
got
into
our
carriages
again

this
time
lord
londonderry
did
not
attempt
to
resume
his
uncomfortable
position


we
went
along
through
the

botanic
garden


and
stopped
and
got
out
to
look
at
the
new
college
which
is
to
be
opened
in
october

it
is
a
handsome
building

we
passed
through
several
of
the
streets
and
returned
to
the
place
of
embarkation


belfast

is
a
fine
town

with
some
good
buildings

for
instance

the

bank

and

exchange



and
is
considered
the

liverpool

and

manchester

of

ireland



i
have
forgotten
to
mention
the
constabulary

who
are
a
remarkably
fine
body
of
men

13
000
in
number

altogether
in

ireland



all
irish

and
chiefly
roman
catholics

and
not
one
of
whom

during
the
trying
times
last
year

fraternised
with
the
rebels


we
left
amid
immense
cheering

and
reached
the
â€œvictoria
and
albertâ€
at
half
past
six

it
was
blowing
as
hard
as
ever

and
the
getting
in
and
out
was
as
disagreeable
as
before

we
decided
on
spending
the
night
where
we
were

unless
the
wind
should
drop
by
three
or
four
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning

many
bonfires
were
lighted
on
the
surrounding
hills
and
coasts






sunday

august
12



the
weather
no
better

and
as
there
seemed
no
hope
of
its
improvement

we
decided
on
starting
at
two
oâ€™clock

and
proceeding
either
to

loch
ryan

or

lamlash


lord
adolphus
read
the
service
at
half
past
ten

at
which
the
two
eldest
children
were
also
present


i
intend
to
create
bertie
â€œearl
of
dublin
â€
as
a
compliment
to
the
town
and
country

he
has
no
irish
title

though
he
is

born

with
several
scotch
ones

belonging
to
the
heirs
to
the
scotch
throne

and
which
we
have
inherited
from
james
vi

of
scotland
and
i

of
england


and
this
was
one
of
my
fatherâ€™s
titles


the
preparations
on
deck
for
the
voyage
were
not
encouraging

the
boats
hoisted
up

the
accommodation
ladders
drawn
quite
close
up

every
piece
of
carpet
removed

and
everything
covered

and

indeed

my
worst
fears
were
realized

we
started
at
two

and
i
went
below
and
lay
down
shortly
after

and
directly
we
got
out
of
the
harbour
the
yacht
began
rolling
for
the
first
three
quarters
of
an
hour

in
a
way
which
was
dreadful

and
there
were
two
rolls

when
the
waves
broke
over
the
ship

which
i
never
shall
forget

it
got
gradually
better

and
at
five
we
entered

loch
ryan


truly
thankful
to
be
at
the
end
of
our
voyage

albert
came
down
to
me
and
then
i
went
up
on
deck

and
he
told
me
how
awful
it
had
been

the
first
great
wave
which
came
over
the
ship
threw
everybody
down
in
every
direction

poor
little
affie
60

was
thrown
down
and
sent
rolling
over
the
deck

and
was
drenched

for
the
deck
was
swimming
with
water

albert
told
me
it
was
quite
frightful
to
see
the
enormous
waves
rising
like
a
wall
above
the
sides
of
the
ship

we
did
not
anchor
so
high
up
in

loch
ryan

as
we
had
done
two
years
ago

but
it
was
a
very
safe
quiet
anchorage

and
we
were
very
glad
to
be
there

albert
went
on
shore



60

prince
alfred






monday

august
13



we
started
at
four
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning

and
the
yacht
rolled
a
little

but
the
motion
was
an
easy
one

we
were
in
the

clyde

by
breakfast
time

but
the
day
was
very
bad

constant
squalls
hiding
the
scenery

we
left

greenock

to
our
left

and
proceeded
a
little
way
up

loch
goil


which
opens
into

loch
long


and
is
very
fine

it
seems
extraordinary
to
have
such
deep
water
in
a
narrow
loch
and
so
immediately
below
the
mountains

which
are
very
rocky

we
turned
back
and
went
up

loch
long


which
i
remembered
so
well

and
which
is
so
beautiful

we
let
go
the
anchor
at

arrochar


the
head
of
the
lake

intending
to
land
and
proceed
to

loch
lomond


where
a
steamer
was
waiting
for
us

but
it
poured
with
rain
most
hopelessly

we
waited
an
hour
in
vain

and
decided
on
stopping
till
after
luncheon
and
making
the
attempt
at
three
oâ€™clock

we
lunched
and
stepped
into
the
boat

as
it
had
cleared
a
little

but
just
then
it
began
pouring
again
more
violently
than
before

and
we
put
back
much
disappointed

but
albert
persevered

and
he
went
off
with
mr

anson

sir
james
clark

and
captain
robinson
almost
directly
afterwards

just
then
it
cleared
and
i
felt
so
vexed
that
we
had
not
gone

but
there
have
been
some
terrible
showers
since

we
left

arrochar

a
little
before
four


loch
long

looking
beautiful
as
we
returned






perth

tuesday

august
14



we
anchored
yesterday
in

roseneath
bay


close
to

roseneath


a
very
pretty
spot

and
looking
towards
the
mountains
which
you
see
in

loch
goil


one
of
them
is
called
â€œthe
duke
of
argyllâ€™s
bowling
green
â€
albert
only
returned
soon
after
eight
oâ€™clock

having
been
able
to
see
a
good
deal
of

loch
lomond


and
even

rob
royâ€™s
cave


in
spite
of
heavy
showers

captain
beechey

who
was
with
us
during
the
whole
voyage
in
â€™47

and
again
the
whole
of
this
one
to
pilot
us


captain
crispin

and
captain
robinson

who
met
us
this
morning
and
piloted
albert
in

loch
lomond


and
did
the
same
for
us
in
â€™47


dined
with
us
also

and
we
had
much
interesting
conversation
about
the
formation
of
glaciers


c


in
all
of
which
captain
beechey

who
is
a
very
intelligent
man

and
has
been
all
over
the
world

took
part

he
was
with
sir
edward
parry
at
the

north
pole


and
told
us
that
they
had
not
seen
daylight
for
four
months

they
heaped
up
snow
over
the
ship
and
covered
it
in
with
boards
to
keep
the
cold
off






balmoral

wednesday

august
15



it
seems
like
a
dream
to
be
here
in
our
dear
highland
home
again

it
certainly
does
not
seem
as
if
it
were
a
year
since
we
were
here

now
i
must
describe
the
doings
of
yesterday

we
embarked
on
board
the
â€œfairyâ€
at
a
quarter
to
nine
oâ€™clock

and
proceeded
up
the

clyde

in
pouring
rain
and
high
wind

and
it
was
very
stormy
till
after
we
had
passed

greenock


we
steamed
past

port
glasgow


then
came

dumbarton

and

erskine


the
river
narrows
and
winds
extraordinarily
here

and
you
do
not
see

glasgow

until
you
are
quite
close
upon
it

as
we
approached

the
banks
were
lined
with
people

either
on
estrades
or
on
the
sea
shore

and
it
was
amusing
to
see
all
those
on
the
shore
take
flight

often
too
late

as
the
water
bounded
up
from
the
swell
caused
by
the
steamer


the
weather

which
had
been
dreadful

cleared
up

just
as
we
reached

glasgow


about
eleven

and
continued
fine
for
the
remainder
of
the
day

several
addresses
were
presented
on
board

first
by
the
lord
provost

who
was
knighted


colonel
gordonâ€™s
sword
being
used


then
one
from
the
county

the
clergy

established
church
and
free
kirk


and
from
the
houses
of
commerce

we
landed
immediately
after
this

the
landing
place
was
very
handsomely
decorated

we
then
entered
our
carriage
with
the
two
eldest
children

the
two
others
following

mr

alison

the
celebrated
historian

who
is
the
sheriff

rode
on
one
side
of
the
carriage

and
general
riddell

the
commander
of
the
forces
in
scotland

on
the
other

the
crowds
assembled
were
quite
enormous

but
excellent
order
was
kept
and
they
were
very
enthusiastic

mr

alison
said
that
there
were
500
000
people
out

the
town
is
a
handsome
one
with
fine
streets
built
in
stone

and
many
fine
buildings
and
churches

we
passed
over
a
bridge
commanding
an
extensive
view
down
two
quays

which
albert
said
was
very
like

paris


there
are
many
large
shops
and
warehouses

and
the
shipping
is
immense


we
went
up
to
the
old
cathedral

where
principal
mac
farlane

a
very
old
man

received
us

and
directed
our
attention

as
we
walked
through
the
church
gates

to
an
immensely
high
chimney

the
highest
i
believe
in
existence

which
belongs
to
one
of
the
manufactories

the
cathedral
is
a
very
fine
one

the
choir
of
which
is
fitted
up
as
a
presbyterian
church

we
were
shown
the
crypt
and
former
burial
place
of
the
bishops

which
is
in
a
very
high
state
of
preservation

the
architecture
is
beautiful

it
is
in
this
crypt
that
the
famous
scene
in

rob
roy

is
laid

where
rob
roy
gives
frank
osbaldistone
warning
that
he
is
in
danger

there
is
an
old
monument
of
st

kentigern

commonly
called
st

mungo

the
founder
of
the
cathedral

we
re
entered
our
carriages
and
went
to
the

university


an
ancient
building

and
which
has
produced
many
great
and
learned
men

here
we
got
out
and
received
an
address

we
only
stopped
a
few
minutes

and
then
went
on
again
towards
the

exchange


in
front
of
which
is
marochettiâ€™s
equestrian
statue
of
the
duke
of
wellington

very
like
and
beautifully
executed

we
got
out
at
the
railway
station
and
started
almost
immediately


we
passed

stirling

in
the
distance

and
a
little
before
four
we
reached

perth


where
the
people
were
very
friendly

we
took
the
four
children
in
our
carriage
and
drove
straight
to
the
â€œgeorge
inn
â€
where
we
had
the
same
rooms
that
we
had
last
time


albert
went
out
immediately
to
see
the
prison

and
at
six
we
drove
together
along
the

london
road


as
they
rather
strangely
call
it


towards

moncrieffe


the
view
was
perfectly
beautiful

and
is
the
finest
of

perth

and
the
grand
bridge
over
the

tay







wednesday

august
15



at
a
quarter
to
eight
oâ€™clock
we
started

the
two
boys
and
vicky
were
in
the
carriage
with
us

alice
followed
with
the
ladies

it
was
a
long
journey

but
through
very
beautiful
scenery

we
saw
the

grampians

as
we
left

perth


we
first
changed
horses
at

blairgowrie


15
miles

then
came
a
very
long
stage
of
20
miles

to
the

spittal
of
glenshee


we
first
passed
the
house
of
a
lieut

colonel
clark
rattray

called

craig
hall


overhanging
a
valley
or
glen
above
which
we
drove

and
after
this
we
came
into
completely
wild
highland
scenery

with
barren
rocky
hills

through
which
the
road
winds
to
the

spittal
of
glenshee


which
can
scarcely
be
called
a
village

for
it
consists
of
only
an
inn
and
two
or
three
cottages

we
got
out
at
the
inn

where
we
found
mr

farquharson
and
his
son

and
some
of
his
men

here
we
had
some
luncheon

and
then
set
off
again

the
next
stage
of
15
miles
to

castleton

is
over
a
very
bad

and
at
night

positively
dangerous
road

through
wild

grand
scenery

with
very
abrupt
turns
and
steep
ascents

one
sharp
turn
is
called

the
devilâ€™s
elbow


the
farquharson
men
joined
us
again
here

some
having
gone
on
before

and
others
having
followed
from
the
inn

skipping
over
stones
and
rocks
with
the
rapidity
and
lightness
peculiar
to
highlanders

they
remained
with
us
till
we
were
able
to
trot
on
again


we
drove
through
a
very
fine
pass
called

cairn
wall

and
were
overtaken
by
a
heavy
shower

when
we
reached

castleton

the
day
had
cleared

and
we
were
able
to
open
the
carriage
again

here
we
were
met
by
sir
alexander
duff
and
the
duke
of
leeds
at
the
head
of
their
men

lady
duff

mr

and
lady
agnes
duff

miss
farquharson

and
several
of
the
children

and
the
duchess
of
leeds

came
up
to
the
carriage

the
drive
from

castleton

to

balmoral


particularly
the
beautiful
part
from
the

balloch
buie


was
well
known
to
us

and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
see
it
all
again
in
its
beauty

grant
had
met
us
at
the

spittal
of
glenshee


and
ridden
the
whole
way
with
us

at
the
door
at

balmoral

were
mackay

who
was
playing

and
macdonald
in
full
dress

it
was
about
four
when
we
arrived





yachting
excursion






on
board
the
victoria
and
albert



dartmouth

thursday

august
20

1846



we
steamed
past
the
various
places
on
the
beautiful
coast
of

devonshire

which
we
had
passed
three
years
ago


seaton



sidmouth


off
which
we
stopped
for
ten
minutes


axmouth



teignmouth



c



till
we
came
to

babbicombe


a
small
bay

where
we
remained
an
hour

it
is
a
beautiful
spot

which
before
we
had
only
passed
at
a
distance

red
cliffs
and
rocks
with
wooded
hills
like

italy


and
reminding
one
of
a
ballet
or
play
where
nymphs
are
to
appear

such
rocks
and
grottos

with
the
deepest
sea

on
which
there
was
not
a
ripple

we
intended
to
disembark
and
walk
up
the
hill

but
it
came
on
to
rain
very
much

and
we
could
not
do
so

we
tried
to
sketch
the
part
looking
towards

torbay


i
never
saw
our
good
children
looking
better

or
in
higher
spirits

i
contrived
to
give
vicky
a
little
lesson

by
making
her
read
in
her
english
history


we
proceeded
on
our
course
again
at
half
past
one
oâ€™clock

and
saw

torquay

very
plainly

which
is
very
fine

the
sea
looked
so
stormy
and
the
weather
became
so
thick
that
it
was
thought
best
to
give
up

plymouth


for
the
third
time


and
to
put
into
that
beautiful

dartmouth


and
we
accordingly
did
so

in
pouring
rain

the
deck
swimming
with
water

and
all
of
us
with
umbrellas

the
children
being
most
anxious
to
see
everything

notwithstanding
the
rain

this
place
is
lovely

with
its
wooded
rocks
and
church
and
castle
at
the
entrance

it
puts
me
much
in
mind
of
the
beautiful

rhine


and
its
fine
ruined
castles

and
the

lurlei



i
am
now
below
writing

and
crowds
of
boats
are
surrounding
us
on
all
sides






plymouth
harbour

friday

august
21



we
got
under
weigh
by
half
past
six
oâ€™clock

and
on
looking
out
we
saw
the
sea
so
calm
and
blue
and
the
sun
so
bright
that
we
determined
to
get
up

it
was
a
very
fine
day

but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
swell

at
length
at
half
past
nine
we
entered
the
splendid
harbour
of

plymouth


and
anchored
again
below

mount
edgcumbe


which

with
its
beautiful
trees

including
pines

growing
down
into
the
sea

looks
more
lovely
than
ever

i
changed
my
dress
and
read
innumerable
letters
and
despatches

and
then
went
on
deck
and
saw
the
authorities

the
admirals
and
generals

i
did
vickyâ€™s
lessons
and
wrote

and
at
half
past
one
we
went
on
board
the
â€œfairy
â€

leaving
the
children
on
board
the
â€œvictoria
and
albert
â€

with
all
our
ladies
and
gentlemen

as
well
as
sir
james
clark

who
has
joined
us
here

we
steamed
up
the

tamar


going
first
a
little
way
up
the

st

germans

river

which
has
very
prettily
wooded
banks


trematon
castle

to
the
right

which
belongs
to
bertie
as
duke
of
cornwall

and

jats

to
the
left

are
extremely
pretty

we
stopped
here
and
afterwards
turned
back
and
went
up
the

tamar


which
at
first
seemed
flat

but
as
we
proceeded
the
scenery
became
quite
beautiful

richly
wooded
hills

the
trees
growing
down
into
the
water

and
the
river
winding
so
much
as
to
have
the
effect
of
a
lake

in
this
it
reminded
me
so
much
of
going
up
the

rhine



though
i
donâ€™t
think
the
river
resembles
the

rhine


albert
thought
it
like
the

danube


the
finest
parts
begin
about

saltash


which
is
a
small
but
prettily
built
town

to
the
right
as
you
go
up
all
is
un
english
looking

a
little
further
on
is
the
mouth
of
the

tavy


here
the
river
becomes
very
beautiful

we
passed
numbers
of
mines
at
work

further
on

to
the
left

we
came
to

pentillie
castle

situated
on
a
height
most
beautifully
wooded
down
to
the
waterâ€™s
edge

and
the
river
winding
rapidly
above
and
below
it

albert
said
it
reminded
him
of
the
situation
of

greinburg

on
the

danube


not
much
further
on
we
came
to
the
picturesque
little
village
and
landing
place
of

cothele


at
the
foot
of
a
thickly
wooded
bank

with
a
valley
on
one
side

here
the
river
is
very
narrow

we
landed

and
drove
up
a
steep
hill
under
fine
trees
to
the
very
curious
old

house
of
cothele


where
we
got
out
of
the
carriage

it
is
most
curious
in
every
way

as
it
stands
in
the
same
state
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
henry
vii

and
is
in
great
preservation

the
old
rooms
hung
with
arras


c


we
drove
down
another
way
under
beautiful
trees
and
above
the
fine
valley

embarked
and
proceeded
down
the
river

the
evening
was
beautiful

the
sun
bright

and
the
sky
and
sea
so
blue

we
arrived
just
too
late
for
the
launch
of
the
frigate
â€œthetis
â€
it
reminded
me
so
much
of
when
we
were
here
three
years
ago

as
we
approached
our
yacht

surrounded
by
myriads
of
boats

and
had
to
row
through
them
in
our
barge

we
returned
at
half
past
five

the
evening
was
delightful

clear

calm

and
cloudless

but
a
good
deal
of
noise
in
the
boats
around
us

lord
and
lady
mount
edgcumbe
and
sir
james
clark
dined
with
us






plymouth

saturday

august
22



albert
was
up
at
six
oâ€™clock

as
he
was
to
go
to

dartmoor
forest


at
ten
i
went
in
the
barge
with
the
two
children

the
ladies

baron
stockmar

and
lord
alfred
paget

and
landed
at

mount
edgcumbe


where
we
were
received
by
lady
mount
edgcumbe

her
two
boys

her
sister
and
nieces

and
beyond
the
landing
place
by
lord
mount
edgcumbe

there
were
crowds
where
we
landed

and
i
feel
so
shy
and
put
out
without
albert

i
got
into
a
carriage
with
the
children
and
lady
mount
edgcumbe

lord
mount
edgcumbe
going
before
us
and
the
others
following

and
took
a
lovely
drive
along
the
road
which
overhangs
the
bay

commanding
such
beautiful
views
on
all
sides

and
going
under
and
by
such
fine
trees

we
had
been
there
three
years
ago

but
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
see
it
again

the
day
very
hot
and
a
little
hazy

we
came
to
the
house
at
eleven

the
children
went
with
their
governess
and
the
other
children
into
the
shade
and
had
luncheon
in
the
house

and
i
remained
in
the
gallery

a
very
pretty
room

with
some
fine
pictures

and
with
a
door
opening
on
the
garden

and
commanding
a
lovely
little
bit
of
sea
view

which
i
tried
to
sketch

a
little
after
twelve
we
returned
to
the
yacht

which
had
been
beset
with
boats
ever
since
six
in
the
morning

albert
returned
safely
to
me
at
one
oâ€™clock

much
pleased
with
his
trip

and
said
that

dartmoor
forest

was
like

scotland



at
two
we
went
with
our
ladies
and
gentlemen

and
without
the
children

again
to
the
landing
place
at

mount
edgcumbe


where
we
were
received
as
before

and
drove
up
to
the
house

there
are
some
of
the
finest
and
tallest
chestnut
trees
in
existence
here

and
the
beech
trees
grow
very
peculiarly

quite
tall
and
straight

the
branches
growing
upwards

we
walked
about
the
gallery
and
looked
into
lady
mount
edgcumbeâ€™s
little
room
at
one
end
of
it

which
is
charming

and
full
of
pretty
little
things
which
she
has
collected

and
then
we
took
luncheon
in
a
room
where
there
are
some
fine
portraits
by
sir
joshua
reynolds

they
are
all
of
the
mount
edgcumbe
family

one
of
whom
was
his
great
patron

sir
joshua
was
born
a
few
miles
from

plymouth


there
are
in
the
same
room
pictures
by
him
when
he
first
began
to
paint

which
have
kept
their
colour

then
when
he
made
experiments

and
these
are
quite
faded

and
again
of
his
works
when
he
discovered
his
mistakes

and
the
colour
of
his
pictures
is
then
beautiful

we
walked
about
the
garden
near
the
house

and
then
drove
to
the
â€œkiosk
â€
by
beautiful
stone
pines
and
pinasters

which
interested
albert
very
much

and
put
me
so
much
in
mind
of
mr

learâ€™s
drawings

the
view
from
this
â€œkiosk
â€
which
is
very
high
over
the
sea
and
town

is
most
beautiful

and
the
sea
was
like
glass

not
a
ripple
to
be
seen

we
walked
down
a
very
pretty
road
or
path
through
the
woods
and
trees
till
we
met
the
carriage

and
we
drove
along
that
beautiful
road

which
is
said
to
be
a
little
like
the

cornice


overhanging
the
sea

down
to
the
place
of
embarkation

where
we
took
leave
of
them
all

and
returned
to
our
yacht
by
half
past
four

poor
lord
mount
edgcumbe
is
in
such
a
sad

helpless
state

but
so
patient
and
cheerful

we
went
on
board
just
to
fetch
the
children

and
then
on
to
the
â€œfairy
â€
and
steamed
in
her
round
the
harbour

or
rather
bay

in
which
there
are
such
pretty
spots

into
the

cat
water


from
whence
we
rowed
in
one
of
the
barges
a
little
way
up
the
river
to
look
at

saltram


lord
morleyâ€™s

after
that
back
to
the
â€œfairy
â€
went
in
her
into

mill
bay



sutton
pool


and

stonehouse


and
returned
to
the
yacht
by
half
past
six






in
guernsey
bay

off
st

pierre

guernsey



sunday

august
23



on
waking

the
morning
was
so
lovely
that
we
could
not
help
regretting
that
we
could
not
delay
our
trip
a
little

by
one
day
at
least

as
the
council
which
was
to
have
been
on
the
25th
is
now
on
the
29th

we
thought

however

we
could
do
nothing
but
sail
for

torbay


at
half
past
nine

and
for

osborne

on
monday

while
dressing

i
kept
thinking
whether
we
could
not
manage
to
see

falmouth


or
something
or
other

albert
thought
we
might
perhaps
manage
to
see
one
of
the

channel
islands


and
accordingly
he
sent
for
lord
adolphus
fitzclarence

and
it
was
settled
that
we
should
go
to

guernsey


which
delighted
me

as
i
had
so
long
wished
to
see
it

the
day
splendid

the
general
and
admiral
came
on
board
to
take
leave

sir
j

west
is
the
admiral

and
general
murray

the
general

and
at
about
half
past
nine
we
set
off

and
the
sea
the
whole
way
was
as
calm
as
it
was
in
â€™43


plymouth

is
beautiful

and
we
shall
always
be
delighted
to
return
there


for
two
hours
we
were
in
expectation
of
seeing
land

but
it
was
very
hazy

and
they
did
not
know
where
we
were

till
about
six

when
land
was
seen
by
the
â€œfairy
â€
who
came
to
report
it

and
then
all
the
other
vessels
went
on
before
us

as
we
approached
we
were
struck
by
the
beauty
of
the

guernsey

coast

in
which
there
are
several
rocky
bays

and
the
town
of

st

pierre

is
very
picturesquely
built

down
to
the
waterâ€™s
edge

you
see

sark


or

sercq


as
you
enter
the
harbour
to
the
right

and
further
on

close
opposite

st

pierre


two
islands
close
together


herm

and

jethou


the
bay
with
these
fine
islands
is
really
most
curious

we
anchored
at
seven

immediately
opposite

st

pierre


and
with
the
two
islands
on
the
other
side
of
us

we
dined
at
eight

and
found
on
going
on
deck
the
whole
town
illuminated

which
had
a
very
pretty
effect

and
must
have
been
done
very
quickly

for
they
had
no
idea
of
our
coming

it
is
built
like
a
foreign
town

the
people
speak
mostly
french
amongst
themselves






august
24




st

pierre

is
very
picturesque
looking

with
very
high

bright
coloured
houses
built
down
almost
into
the
sea

the
college
and
church
are
very
conspicuous
buildings

this
island
with
its
bold
point

and
the
little
one
of

cornet

with
a
sort
of
castle
on
it

close
to
which
we
were
anchored


and
the
three
islands
of

herm



jethou


and

sark


with
innumerable
rocks

are
really
very
fine
and
peculiar


especially
as
they
then
were
in
bright
sunlight

we
both
sketched

and
at
a
quarter
to
nine
got
into
our
barge
with
our
ladies

the
pier
and
shore
were
lined
with
crowds
of
people

and
with
ladies
dressed
in
white

singing
â€œgod
save
the
queen
â€
and
strewing
the
ground
with
flowers

we
walked
to
our
carriage

preceded
by
general
napier

brother
to
sir
charles

in

scinde



a
very
singular
looking
old
man

tall
and
thin

with
an
aquiline
nose

piercing
eyes

and
white
moustaches
and
hair

the
people
were
extremely
well
behaved
and
friendly

and
received
us
very
warmly
as
we
drove
through
the
narrow
streets

which
were
decorated
with
flowers
and
flags

and
lined
with
the

guernsey

the
vegetation
beyond
the

is
exceedingly
fine

and
the
evergreens
and
flowers
most
abundant

the
streets
and
hills
steep

and
the
view
from
the

which
is
very
high


and
where
general
napier
presented
me
with

is
extremely
beautiful

you
look
over
the

very
flourishing

in

this
is
the

in

they
belonged
to

been

was
the
last
of
their
sovereigns
who
visited
them

we
drove
along
the
pier

and
then
embarked
amidst
great
cheering

it
was
all
admirably
managed

we
came

all

the

alderney

is
quite
different
from
all
the
other
islands

excessively
rocky
and
barren

and
the
rocks
in

at

and
embarked
at

osborne
pier


there
was
a
good
deal
of
swell

it
was
fine

but
very
cold
at
first

at
twelve
we
saw

alderney


and
between
two
and
three
got
into
the

alderney
race


where
there
was
a
great
deal
of
rolling

but
not
for
long

we
passed
between

alderney

and
the
french
coast


cape
de
la
hague


and
saw
the
other
side
of

alderney


and
then

later


sark



guernsey


and
the
other
islands

after
passing
the

alderney
race


it
became
quite
smooth

and
then
bertie
put
on
his
sailorâ€™s
dress

which
was
beautifully
made
by
the
man
on
board
who
makes
for
our
sailors

when
he
appeared

the
officers
and
sailors

who
were
all
assembled
on
deck
to
see
him

cheered

and
seemed
delighted
with
him


the
coast
of

jersey

is
very
beautiful

and
we
had
to
go
nearly
all
round

in
order
to
get
to

st

heliers


we
first
passed
the
point
called

rondnez


then

grosnez

with
a
tower


st

ouenâ€™s
bay



la
rocca


a
curious
old
tower
on
a
rock

and
then

breladeâ€™s
bay


the
red
cliffs
and
rocks

with
the
setting
sun
gilding
and
lighting
them
all
up

were
beautiful

at
last

at
a
quarter
to
seven

we
arrived
in
this
fine
large
bay
of

st

aubin


in
which
lies

st

heliers


and
after
dinner
we
went
on
deck
to
see
the
illumination
and
the
bonfires






off
st

thursday

september

a
splendid
day

i
never
saw
a
more
beautiful
deep
blue
sea

quite
like

naples


and
albert
said
that
this
fine
bay
of

st

aubin


in
which
we
lie

really
is
like
the

bay
of
naples



noirmont
point

terminates
in
a
low
tower
to
our
left

with

st

aubin

and
a
tower
on
a
rock
in
front
of
it

farther
in

and
to
our
right


elizabeth
castle


a
picturesque
fort
on
a
rock

with
the
town
of

st

heliers

behind
it


the
colouring
and
the
effect
of
light
were
indescribably
beautiful

we
got
into
our
barge
with
our
ladies
and
gentlemen

and
then
went
on
board
the
â€œfairy
â€
until
we
were
close
to
the
harbour

and
then
we
got
into
the
barge
again

we
landed
at
the
stairs
of
the

victoria
harbour


amid
the
cheers
of
the
numberless
crowds

guns
firing

and
bands
playing

were
received

as
at

guernsey


by
all
the
ladies
of
the
town

very
gaily
dressed

who

strewing
flowers
on
our
way

conducted
us
to
a
canopy

where
i
received
the
address
of
the
states
and
of
the
militia


we
then
got
into
our
carriage
and
drove
along
the
pier

colonel
le
couteur

my
militia
aide
de
camp

riding
by
my
side

with
other
officers

and
by
albertâ€™s
side
colonel
le
breton

commanding
the
militia

who

5
000
strong

lined
the
streets

and
were
stationed
along
the
pier

the
states
walking
in
front

the
crowds
were
immense

but
everything
in
excellent
order

and
the
people
most
enthusiastic

though
not
more
so
than
the
good

guernsey

people

the
town
is
much
larger

and
they
had
much
longer
time
for
preparations

the
decorations
and
arches
of
flowers
were
really
beautifully
done

and
there
were
numberless
kind
inscriptions

all
the
country
people
here
speak
french

and
so
did
the
police
who
walked
near
us

it
was
a
very
gratifying
reception

there
was
a
seat
in
one
of
the
streets
filled
by
frenchwomen
from

granville


curiously
dressed
with
white
handkerchiefs
on
their
heads

after
passing
through
several
streets
we
drove
up
to
the

government
house


but
did
not
get
out

general
gibbs

the
governor

is
very
infirm


we
then
proceeded
at
a
quicker
pace

the
walking
procession
having
ceased

through
the
interior
of
the
island

which
is
extremely
pretty
and
very
green


orchards
without
end

as
at

mayence


we
passed
the
curious
old
tower
of

la
hougue
bie


of
very
ancient
date

and
went
to
the

castle
of
mont
orgueil


in

grouville
bay


very
beautifully
situated

completely
overhanging
the
sea

and
where
robert

duke
of
normandy

son
of
william
the
conqueror

is
said
to
have
lived

62

we
walked
part
of
the
way
up

and
from
one
of
the
batteries

where
no
guns
are
now
mounted

you
command
the
bay

and
the
french
coast
is
distinctly
seen

only
13
miles
distant

the
people
are
very
proud
that

mont
orgueil

had
never
been
taken

but
i
have
since
learnt
it
was
taken
by
surprise
and
held
for
a
few
days


guernsey


however


never

was
taken

63



62

mont
orgueil
was
also
called
gouray
castle

duke
robert
the
second

the
conquerorâ€™s
son

lived
at
gouray
castle
in
normandy

duke
robert
the
first

commonly
called
â€œrobert
le
diable
â€
was
in
jersey
for
twelve
days

and

during
that
time

probably
occupied
gouray
castle
in
that
island

hence
may
have
arisen
the
tradition
of
robert
the
second
having
lived
there

of
which
there
is
no
evidence


ed



63

the
public
records
certainly
state
that
guernsey
was
taken
by
the
french
in
1339

but
the
same
records
show
that
it
was
again
in
the
possession
of
the
english
as
early
as
january
1340

the
tradition

therefore

â€œthat
guernsey
never
was
taken
â€
may
be
true

as
the
occupation
by
the
french
might
only
have
been
partial

viz


of
castle
cornet
and
the
vicinity

and
this
might
have
been
magnified

by
report
in
england

into
a
conquest
of
the
whole
island

popular
traditions

contradicted
at
first
by
documentary
evidence

are
often
eventually
found
to
be
true

everything
depends
upon
the
meaning
of
the
words
â€œtakenâ€
and
â€œconquered
â€
it
could
hardly
have
been
said
that
england
had
been
â€œconqueredâ€
by
the
normans

while
the
gallant
hereward
held
out
in
the
isle
of
ely


ed


we
then
returned
to
our
carriage

and
proceeded
to
the
pier
by
a
shorter
road

and
through
a
different
part
of
the
town

there
is
a
peculiar
elm
tree
in
the
island

which
is
very
pretty

and
unlike
any
other


the
leaf
and
the
way
it
grows
almost
resembling
the
acacia

the
crowd
was
very
great
and
the
heat
very
intense
in
going
back


we
re
embarked
in
the
barge

but
had
only
to
go
a
few
yards
to
the
â€œfairy
â€
the
situation
of
the
harbour
is
very
fine


and
crowned
with
the
fort

and
covered
by
numbers
of
people

was
like
an
amphitheatre

the
heat
of
the
sun

and
the
glare

had
made
me
so
ill
and
giddy
that
i
remained
below
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon

and
albert
went
out
for
an
hour
on
the
â€œfairy
â€





falmouth
harbour

friday

september
4



a
beautiful
day
again

with
the
same
brilliantly
blue
sea

at
a
quarter
to
eight
oâ€™clock
we
got
under
weigh

there
was
a
great
deal
of
motion
at
first

and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
the
ship
pitched

but
getting
up
the
sails
steadied
her

from
five
oâ€™clock
it
became
quite
smooth

at
half
past
five
we
saw
land

and
at
seven
we
entered

falmouth
harbour


where
we
were
immediately
surrounded
by
boats

the
evening
was
beautiful
and
the
sea
as
smooth
as
glass

and
without
even
a
ripple

the
calmest
night
possible

with
a
beautiful
moon

when
we
went
on
deck

every
now
and
then
the
splashing
of
oars
and
the
hum
of
voices
were
heard

but
they
were
the
only
sounds

unlike
the
constant
dashing
of
the
sea
against
the
vessel

which
we
heard
all
the
time
we
were
at

jersey







mountâ€™s
bay

cornwall

saturday

september
5



at
eight
oâ€™clock
we
left

falmouth

and
proceeded
along
the
coast
of

cornwall


which
becomes
bold
and
rugged
beyond
the

lizard
point

and
as
one
approaches

landâ€™s
end


at
about
twelve
we
passed

landâ€™s
end


which
is
very
fine
and
rocky

the
view
from
thence
opening
beautifully

we
passed
quite
close
by
the

longships


some
rocks
on
which
stands
a
lighthouse

the
sea
was
unusually
smooth
for
the

landâ€™s
end


we
went
beyond
a
point
with
some
rocks
near
it

called

the
brisons


and
then
steamed
back

the
famous
botallack
mine
lies
here

a
little
before
two
we
landed
in
this
beautiful

mountâ€™s
bay


close
below

st

michaelâ€™s
mount


which
is
very
fine

when
the
bay
first
opened
to
our
view
the
sun
was
lighting
up
this
beautiful
castle

so
peculiarly
built
on
a
lofty
rock

and
which
forms
an
island
at
high
water



illustration


in
entering
the
bay
we
passed
the
small
village
of

mousehole

and
the
town
of

penzance


which
is
prettily
situated

about
one
mile
and
a
half
from

st

michaelâ€™s
mount


the
day
brightened
just
as
we
arrived

and
the
sea
again
became
so
blue


soon
after
our
arrival
we
anchored

the
crowd
of
boats
was
beyond
everything

numbers
of
cornish
pilchard
fishermen

in
their
curious
large
boats

kept
going
round
and
round

and
then
anchored

besides
many
other
boats
full
of
people

they
are
a
very
noisy

talkative
race

and
speak
a
kind
of
english
hardly
to
be
understood


during
our
voyage
i
was
able
to
give
vicky
her
lessons

at
three
oâ€™clock
we
all
got
into
the
barge

including
the
children
and
mdlle

gruner

their
governess

and
rowed
through
an
avenue
of
boats
of
all
descriptions
to
the
â€œfairy
â€
where
we
went
on
board

the
getting
in
and
out
of
the
barge
was
no
easy
task

there
was
a
good
deal
of
swell

and
the
â€œfairyâ€
herself
rolled
amazingly

we
steamed
round
the
bay
to
look
at

st

michaelâ€™s
mount

from
the
other
side

which
is
even
more
beautiful

and
then
went
on
to

penzance


albert
landed
near

penzance

with
all
the
gentlemen

except
lord
spencer

who
is
most
agreeable

efficient

and
useful
at
sea

being
a
captain
of
the
navy

and
colonel
grey

and
went
to
see
the
smelting
of
copper
and
tin

and
the
works
in
serpentine
stone
at

penzance


we
remained
here
a
little
while
without
going
on

in
order
to
sketch

and
returned
to
the
â€œvictoria
and
albertâ€
by
half
past
four

the
boats
crowding
round
us
in
all
directions

and
when
bertie
showed
himself
the
people
shouted
â€”â€œthree
cheers
for
the
duke
of
cornwall
â€
albert
returned
a
little
before
seven

much
gratified
by
what
he
had
seen

and
bringing
home
specimens
of
the
serpentine
stone






mountâ€™s
bay

sunday

september
6



a
hazy

dull
looking
morning

but
as
calm
as
it
possibly
could
be

at
half
past
eight
oâ€™clock
we
got
into
our
barge

with
miss
kerr
and
lord
spencer

and
proceeded
without
any
standard
to
the
little
harbour
below

st

michaelâ€™s
mount


behind

st

michaelâ€™s
mount

is
the
little
town
of

marazion


or
â€œmarket
jew
â€
which
is
supposed
to
have
taken
its
name
from
the
jews
having
in
former
times
trafficked
there

we
disembarked
and
walked
up
the

mount

by
a
circuitous
rugged
path
over
rocks
and
turf

and
entered
the
old
castle

which
is
beautifully
kept

and
must
be
a
nice
house
to
live
in

as
there
are
so
many
good
rooms
in
it

the
dining
room

made
out
of
the
refectory

is
very
pretty

it
is
surrounded
by
a
frieze

representing
ancient
hunting

the
chapel
is
excessively
curious

the
organ
is
much
famed

albert
played
a
little
on
it

and
it
sounded
very
fine

below
the
chapel
is
a
dungeon

where
some
years
ago
was
discovered
the
skeleton
of
a
large
man
without
a
coffin

the
entrance
is
in
the
floor
of
one
of
the
pews

albert
went
down
with
lord
spencer

and
afterwards
went
with
him
and
sir
james
clark

who

with
lord
palmerston
and
colonel
grey

had
joined
us


up
to
the
tower

on
the
top
of
which
is
â€œst

michaelâ€™s
chair
â€
which

it
is
said

betrothed
couples
run
up
to

and
whoever
gets
first
into
the
chair
will
have
at
home
the
government
of
the
house

and
the
old
housekeeper

a
nice
tidy
old
woman

said
many
a
couple
â€œdoes
go
there
â€
though
albert
and
lord
spencer
said
it
was
the
awkwardest
place
possible
to
get
at


st

michaelâ€™s
mount

belongs
to
sir
j

st

aubyn

there
were
several
drawings
there
of

mont
st

michel

in

normandy


which
is
very
like
this
one

and
was

i
believe

inhabited
by
the
same
order
of
monks
as
this
was


i
e


benedictines

we
walked
down
again

had
to
step
over
another
boat
in
order
to
get
into
our
barge

as
the
tide
was
so
very
low

and
returned
on
board
the
yacht
before
ten


the
view
from
the
top
of

st

michaelâ€™s

is
very
beautiful
and
very
extensive

but
unfortunately
it
was
too
thick
and
hazy
to
see
it
well

a
low
ridge
of
sand
separates

st

michaelâ€™s
mount

from

marazion

at
low
water

and
the
sea
at
high
water

from
the
sand
to
the
summit
of
the
castle
is
about
250
feet

the
chapel
was
originally
erected

they
say

for
the
use
of
pilgrims
who
came
here

and
it
owes
its
name
to
a
tradition
of
st

michael
the
archangel
having
rested
on
the
rock


at
half
past
eleven
lord
spencer
read
on
deck
the
short
morning
service
generally
read
at
sea

which
only
lasted
twenty
or
twenty
five
minutes

the
awning
was
put
up

and
flags
on
the
sides

and
all
the
officers
and
sailors
were
there

as
well
as
ourselves

a
flag
was
hoisted

as
is
usual
when
the
service
is
performed
on
board
ship

and
lord
spencer
read
extremely
well


albert
made
a
most
beautiful
little
sketch
of

st

michaelâ€™s
mount


soon
after
two
we
left

mountâ€™s
bay


about
four
we
came
opposite
to
some
very
curious
serpentine
rocks

between

mountâ€™s
bay

and

lizard
point


and
we
stopped

that
albert
might
land

the
gentlemen
went
with
him

lord
spencer
soon
returned

saying
that
albert
was
very
anxious
i
should
see
the
beautiful
little
cave
in
these
serpentine
rocks

and
accordingly
i
got
into
the
barge

with
the
children

and
ladies

and
lord
spencer

and
we
rowed
to
these
rocks

with
their
caves
and
little
creeks

there
were
many
cormorants
and
sea
gulls
on
the
rocks

we
returned
again

and
were
soon
joined
by
albert

who
brought
many
fine
specimens
which
he
had
picked
up

the
stone
is
really
beautifully
marked
with
red
and
green
veins


we
proceeded
on
our
course

and
reached

falmouth

before
seven

the
fine
afternoon
was
changed
to
a
foggy

dull

cold
evening

we
have
had
on
board
with
us

since
we
left

falmouth


mr

taylor

mineral
agent
to
the
duchy
of
cornwall

a
very
intelligent
young
man

married
to
a
niece
of
sir
charles
lemonâ€™s






falmouth

monday

september
7



immediately
after
breakfast

albert
left
me
to
land
and
visit
some
mines

the
corporation
of

penryn

were
on
board

and
very
anxious
to
see
â€œthe
duke
of
cornwall
â€
so
i
stepped
out
of
the
pavilion
on
deck
with
bertie

and
lord
palmerston
told
them
that
that
was
â€œthe
duke
of
cornwall
â€
and
the
old
mayor
of

penryn

said
that
â€œhe
hoped
he
would
grow
up
a
blessing
to
his
parents
and
to
his
country
â€

a
little
before
four
oâ€™clock

we
all
got
into
the
barge

with
the
two
children

and
rowed
to
the
â€œfairy
â€
we
rowed
through
a
literal

lane

of
boats

full
of
people

who
had
surrounded
the
yacht
ever
since
early
in
the
morning

and
proceeded
up
the
river
by

st

justâ€™s
pool


to
the
left
of
which
lies
sir
c

lemonâ€™s
place

and

trefusis

belonging
to
lord
clinton

we
went
up
the

truro


which
is
beautiful


something
like
the

tamar


but
almost
finer

though
not
so
bold
as

pentillie
castle

and

cothele



winding
between
banks
entirely
wooded
with
stunted
oak

and
full
of
numberless
creeks

the
prettiest
are

king
harryâ€™s
ferry

and
a
spot
near

tregothnan


lord
falmouthâ€™s


where
there
is
a
beautiful
little
boat
house

quite
in
the
woods

and
on
the
river

at
the
point
where
the

tregony

separates
from
the

truro


albert
said
the
position
of
this
boat
house
put
him
in
mind
of
tellâ€™s
chapel
in

switzerland


we
went
a
little
way
up
the

tregony


which
is
most
beautiful

with
high
sloping
banks

thickly
wooded
down
to
the
waterâ€™s
edge

then
we
turned
back
and
went
up
the

truro

to

malpas


another
bend
of
the
river

from
whence
one
can
see

truro


the
capital
of

cornwall


we
stopped
here
awhile

as
so
many
boats
came
out
from
a
little
place
called

sunny
corner


just
below

truro


in
order
to
see
us

indeed
the
whole
population
poured
out
on
foot
and
in
carts


c

along
the
banks

and
cheered

and
were
enchanted
when
bertie
was
held
up
for
them
to
see

it
was
a
very
pretty

gratifying
sight


we
went
straight
on
to

swan
pool

outside

pendennis
castle


where
we
got
into
the
barge

and
rowed
near
to
the
shore
to
see
a
net
drawn

mr

fox

a
quaker

who
lives
at

falmouth


and
has
sent
us
flowers

fruit

and
many
other
things

proposed
to
put
in
his
net
and
draw

that
we
might
see
all
sorts
of
fish
caught

but
when
it
was
drawn
there
was
not
one
fish

so
we
went
back
to
the
â€œfairy
â€
the
water
near
the
shore
in

swan
pool

is
so
wonderfully
clear
that
one
could
count
the
pebbles






tuesday

september
8



a
wet
morning
when
we
rose
and
breakfasted
with
the
children

at
about
ten
oâ€™clock
we
entered

fowey


which
is
situated
in
a
creek
much
like

dartmouth


only
not
so
beautiful

but
still
very
pretty

we
got
into
the
barge

leaving
the
children
on
board

and
also
lord
spencer

who
was
not
quite
well


and
landed
at

fowey

with
our
ladies
and
gentlemen

and
mr

taylor

whom
we
had
brought
with
us
from

falmouth


we
got
into
our
carriage
with
the
ladies

the
gentlemen
following
in
others

and
drove
through
some
of
the
narrowest
streets
i
ever
saw
in

england


and
up
perpendicular
hills
in
the
streets

it
really
quite
alarmed
one

but
we
got
up
and
through
them
quite
safely

we
then
drove
on
for
a
long
way

on
bad
and
narrow
roads

higher
and
higher
up

commanding
a
fine
and
very
extensive
view
of
the
very
hilly
country
of

cornwall


its
hills
covered
with
fields

and
intersected
by
hedges

at
last
we
came
to
one
field
where
there
was
no
road
whatever

but
we
went
down
the
hill
quite
safely

and
got
out
of
the
carriage
at
the
top
of
another
hill

where

surrounded
by
woods

stands
a
circular
ruin

covered
with
ivy

of
the
old
castle
of

restormel


belonging
to
the
duchy
of
cornwall

and
in
which
the
last
earl
of
cornwall
lived
in
the
thirteenth
century

it
was
very
picturesque
from
this
point


we
visited
here
the
restormel
mine

belonging
also
to
the
duchy
of
cornwall

it
is
an
iron
mine

and
you
go
in
on
a
level

albert
and
i
got
into
one
of
the
trucks
and
were
dragged
in
by
miners

mr

taylor
walking
behind
us

the
miners
wear
a
curious
woollen
dress

with
a
cap
like
this


illustration

and
the
dress
thus


illustration

and
they
generally
have
a
candle
stuck
in
front
of
the
cap

this
time
candlesticks
were
stuck
along
the
sides
of
the
mine

and
those
who
did
not
drag
or
push
the
truck
carried
lights

albert
and
the
gentlemen
wore
minersâ€™
hats

there
was
no
room
for
any
one
to
pass
between
the
trucks
and
the
rock

and
only
just
room
enough
to
hold
up
oneâ€™s
head

and
not
always
that

it
had
a
most
curious
effect

and
there
was
something
unearthly
about
this
lit
up
cavern
like
place

we
got
out
and
scrambled
a
little
way
to
see
the
veins
of
ore

and
albert
knocked
off
some
pieces

but
in
general
it
is
blown
by
gunpowder

being
so
hard

the
miners
seemed
so
pleased
at
seeing
us

and
are
intelligent

good
people

it
was
quite
dazzling
when
we
came
into
daylight
again


we
then
got
into
our
carriage
and
passed
through
the
small
town
of

lostwithiel


where
an
address
was
presented
to
us

and
then
we
passed
through
mr

agar
robartsâ€™
park

which
reminded
one
of

cothele


we
returned
by
the
same
road
till
near

fowey


when
we
went
through
some
of
the
narrowest
lanes
i
almost
ever
drove
through

and
so
fearfully
stony

we
drove
along
high
above
the
river
to

place


belonging
to
mr

treffry

which
has
been
restored
according
to
drawings
in
his
possession

representing
the
house
as
it
was
in
former
times

a
lady
of
that
name
defended
the
house
against
the
french
during
the
absence
of
her
husband

in
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
century

the
old
gentleman
showed
us
all
over
the
house

and
into
an
unfinished
hall

lined
with
marble
and
porphyry

all
of
which
came
from

cornwall


we
then
walked
down
to
the
place
of
embarkation
and
proceeded
at
once
to
the
yacht

mr

taylor
deserved
the
greatest
credit
for
all
the
arrangements

he
and
his
father
are

are
called
â€œadventurersâ€

wednesday

september

we
got
up
about
seven
oâ€™clock
and
found
we
had
just
passed

the
needles






visit
to
the
lakes
of
killarney






tuesday

august
27

1861



at
eleven
oâ€™clock
we
all
started
in
our
own
sociable

and
another
of
our
carriages

and
on
ponies

for

ross
castle


the
old
ruin
which
was
a
celebrated
stronghold

and
from
which
the
kenmare
family
take
their
name

here
there
was
an
immense
crowd
and
a
great
many
boats

we
got
into
a
very
handsome
barge
of
eight
oars

beautifully
rowed

lord
castlerosse
steering

the
four
children

and
lady
churchill

lady
castlerosse

and
lord
granville
were
with
us


we
rowed
first
round

innisfallen
island

and
some
way
up
the

lower
lake


the
view
was
magnificent

we
had
a
slight
shower

which
alarmed
us
all

from
the
mist
which
overhung
the
mountains

but
it
suddenly
cleared
away
and
became
very
fine
and
very
hot

at
a
quarter
to
one
we
landed
at
the
foot
of
the
beautiful
hill
of

glena


where
on
a
small
sloping
lawn
there
is
a
very
pretty
little
cottage

we
walked
about

though
it
was
overpoweringly
hot

to
see
some
of
the
splendid
views

the
trees
are
beautiful


oak

birch

arbutus

holly

yew


all
growing
down
to
the
waterâ€™s
edge

intermixed
with
heather

the
hills

rising
abruptly
from
the
lake

are
completely
wooded

which
gives
them
a
different
character
from
those
in

scotland


though
they
often
reminded
me
of
the
dear

highlands


we
returned
to
the
little
cottage

where
the
quantity
of
midges
and
the
smell
of
peat
made
us
think
of

alt
na
giuthasach


upstairs

from
lady
castlerosseâ€™s
little
room

the
view
was
towards
a
part
of
the

lower
lake


the
outline
of
which
is
rather
low

we
lunched

and
afterwards
re
embarked

and
then
took
that
most
beautiful
row
up
the
rapid

under
the

old
weir
bridge


through
the
channel
which
connects
the
two
lakes

and
which
is
very
intricate
and
narrow

close
to
our
right
as
we
were
going

we
stopped
under
the
splendid
hill
of
the

eagleâ€™s
nest

to
hear
the

echo

of
a
bugle

the
sound
of
which

though
blown
near
by

was
not
heard

we
had
to
get
out
near
the

weir
bridge

to
let
the
empty
boats
be
pulled
up
by
the
men

the
sun
had
come
out
and
lit
up
the
really
magnificent
scenery
splendidly

but
it
was
most
oppressively
hot

we
wound
along
till
we
entered
the

upper
lake


which
opened
upon
us
with
all
its
high
hills

the
highest


the
reeks


3
400
feet
high

and
its
islands
and
points
covered
with
splendid
trees


such
arbutus

quite
large
trees

with
yews

making
a
beautiful
foreground

we
turned
into
a
small
bay
or
creek

where
we
got
out
and
walked
a
short
way
in
the
shade

and
up
to
where
a
tent
was
placed

just
opposite
a
waterfall
called

derricaunihy


a
lovely
spot

but
terribly
infested
by
midges

in
this
tent
was
tea

fruit

ice

cakes

and
everything
most
tastefully
arranged

we
just
took
some
tea

which
was
very
refreshing
in
the
great
heat
of
this
relaxing
climate

the
vegetation
is
quite
that
of
a
jungle

ferns
of
all
kinds
and
shrubs
and
trees


all
springing
up
luxuriantly

we
entered
our
boats
and
went
back
the
same
way
we
came

admiring
greatly
the
beauty
of
the
scenery

and
this
time
went
down
the
rapids
in
the
boat

no
boats

except
our
own

had
followed
us
beyond
the
rapids

but
below
them
there
were
a
great
many

and
the
scene
was
very
animated
and
the
people
very
noisy
and
enthusiastic

the
irish
always
give
that
peculiar
shrill
shriek

unlike
anything
one
ever
hears
anywhere
else






wednesday

august
28



at
a
quarter
past
eleven
we
started
on
a
most
beautiful
drive

of
which
i
annex
the
route

we
drove
with
mrs

herbert
and
bertie
in
our
sociable

driven
from
the
box
by
wagland

64

and

though
the
highest
mountains
were
unfortunately
occasionally
enveloped
in
mist

and
we
had
slight
showers

we
were
enchanted
with
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
scenery

the
peeps
of
the
lake

the
splendid
woods
full
of
the
most
magnificent
arbutus

which
in
one
place
form

for
a
few
yards

an
avenue
under
which
you
drive

with
the
rocks


which
are
very
peculiar

all
made
it
one
of
the
finest
drives
we
had
ever
taken

turning
up
by
the
village
and
going
round

the

torc

mountain
reminded
us
of

scotland


of
the
woods
above

abergeldie


of

craig
daign

and

craig
clunie


it
was

so

fine

we
got
out
at
the
top
of
the

torc
waterfall

and
walked
down
to
the
foot
of
it

we
came
home
at
half
past
one

at
four
we
started
for
the
boats

quite
close
by

the

muckross
lake

is
extremely
beautiful

at
the
beginning
of
our
expedition
it
looked
dark
and
severe
in
the
mist
and
showers
which
kept
coming
on

just
as
it
does
in
the

highlands


mr

herbert
steered

our
girls

mrs

herbert

lady
churchill

and
lord
granville
were
in
the
boat
with
us

the
two
boys
went
in
a
boat
rowed
by
gentlemen

and
the
rest
in
two
other
boats

at
mr

and
mrs

herbertâ€™s
request
i
christened
one
of
the
points
which
runs
into
the
lake
with
a
bottle
of
wine

albert
holding
my
arm
when
we
came
close
by

so
that
it
was
most
successfully
smashed



64

my
coachman
since
1857

and
a
good

zealous
servant

he
entered
the
royal
service
in
1831

and
rode
as
postilion
for
seventeen
years

his
father
has
been
thirty
two
years
porter
in
the
royal
mews
at
windsor

and
is
now
seventy
five
years
old

and
has
been
sixty
years
in
the
service

his
grandfather
was
also
in
the
royal
service

having
entered
it
in
1788

and
his
daughter
is
nursery
maid
to
the
prince
of
walesâ€™s
children

four
generations

therefore

have
served
the
royal
family


when
we
emerged
from
under

brickeen
bridge

we
had
a
fine
view
of
the

lower
lake

and
of
the
scenery
of
yesterday

which
rather
puzzled
me

seeing
it
from
another

point
de
vue


at

bensonâ€™s
point

we
stopped
for
some
time

merely
rowing
about
backwards
and
forwards

or
remaining
stationary

watching
for
the
deer

all
this
is
a
deer
forest
as
well
as
at

glena



which
we
expected
the
dogs
would
find
and
bring
down
into
the
water

but
in
vain

we
waited
till
past
six
and
no
deer
came

the
evening
had
completely
cleared
and
became
quite
beautiful

and
the
effect
of
the
numbers
of
boats
full
of
people

many
with
little
flags

rowing
about
in
every
direction
and
cheering
and
shouting

lit
up
by
the
evening
light

was
charming

at

darbyâ€™s
garden

the
shore
was
densely
crowded

and
many
of
the
women
in
their
blue
cloaks
waded
into
the
water

holding
their
clothes
up
to
their
knees


we
were
home
by
seven
oâ€™clock

having
again
a
slight
sprinkling
of
rain
