When reading about hexadecimal colour codes, I read that FF in hexadecimal is equal to 255 (in base 10). This makes sense because hexadecimal is base 16 (NOT base 6) and F in hexadecimal represents 15 in base 10, because in hexadecimal you need extra letters (A to F) do represent the base 10 numbers 10 to 15 that would be apparent at a particular digit position in hexademical, if you want to make each digit a single character. Therefore, FF is digit 15 followed by digit 15, so 15 * 16**1 + 15 * 16**0 = 240 + 15 = 255. Do not make the mistake of simply multiplying 15 by 15.

See repos/css-exercises/06-cascade-fix/style.css for comments that talk about what to do when you compare the highest-priority selector and there's the same quantity of each, but other selectors are present. Hint: you then compare the second-highest-priority selectors' quantity.
