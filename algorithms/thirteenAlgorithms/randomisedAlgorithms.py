# Learn about randomised algorithms at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r2D32esF3Y&t=974s--you might even be able to
# practice them in questions on LeetCode (for example) that you must successfully operate on a fixed number of test
# cases to pass. There are more videos by Kamil (Errichto) on this if you need them.

# Randomised algorithms are VERY INTERESTING.

# "Randomized algorithms are used when presented with a time or memory constraint, and an average case solution is an
# acceptable output. Due to the potential erroneous output of the algorithm, an algorithm known as amplification is
# used in order to boost the probability of correctness by sacrificing runtime". See #
