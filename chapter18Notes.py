# 18.2 Class attributes


# Variables like suit_names and rank_names, which are defined inside a class but outside
# of any method, are called class attributes because they are associated with the class object
# Card. This term distinguishes them from variables like suit and rank (which are made by self.suit and self.rank when
# the Card object is initalised), which are called instance attributes because they are associated with a particular
# instance.

# Card.rank_names will access the class attribute, while self.rank will access the instance attribute, 'self' referring
# to a particular Card object.

# 18.7 Inheritance

# When you define a class that inherits from another, it will inherit the other's __init__; you might have to override
# it by writing an __init__ for the child class (the class that inherits).


# 18.8 Class diagrams

# HAS-A relationship: objects of one class contain references to objects in another class. ThinkPython2e says Deck and
# Card have a HAS-A relationship, since a Deck HAS A Card (or multiple of them).

# IS-A: one class might inherit from another, so a Hand IS A type of Deck.

# DEPENDENCY: objects of one class might take objects of another class as parameters, or use objects of the other class
# as part of a computation. The book doesn't say that Deck and Card have a DEPENDENCY, probably because neither takes
# objects of the other as parameters in its __init__ method.
# TODO: check the above


# 18.9 Debugging

# You can have child classes that inherit from parent classes but override their methods. So, when a method is invoked
# upon an object in a complex script where there are many is-a relationships (i.e. a child class is a version of a
# parent class), then when you invoke a method of an object, it might be confusing which method is being invoked (i.e.
# which class it belongs to). The easiest way to debug and follow the flow of execution here is to add print statements
# to the beginning of the relevent methods, e.g. "Running {class}'s {method}". An alternative way is using the
# following function:

def find_defining_class(obj, meth_name):
    for ty in type(obj).mro():
        if meth_name in ty.__dict__:
            return ty

# Hereâ€™s a design suggestion: when you override a method, the interface of the new method
# should be the same as the old. It should take the same parameters, return the same type,
# and obey the same preconditions and postconditions. If you follow this rule, you will find
# that any function designed to work with an instance of a parent class, like a Deck, will also
# work with instances of child classes like a Hand and PokerHand. This is called the Liskov substitution principle.


# 18.10 Data encapsulation

# Data encapsulation is a good way of discovering class interfaces that allow us to make a sound development plan. See
# the current chapter for a good example regarding Markov analysis.

# Step by step data encapsulation development plan:

# 1. Start by writing functions that read and write global variables (when necessary).
# 2. Once you get the program working, look for associations between global variables
# and the functions that use them.
# 3. Encapsulate related variables as attributes of an object.
# 4. Transform the associated functions into methods of the new class.
